skhoromi@health.ucsd.edu abstract: an increased risk of ischemic stroke in migraine with aura (ma) has been consistently demonstrated. the pathophysiology of risk factors is not yet well understood. several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between ma and ischemic stroke including decreased focal cerebral blood flow and other phenomena linked with cortical spreading depression (csd) as well as neurovascular pathology, which appear to play a key role in ma. in addition to genetic predisposition, other classic stroke risk factors such as atrial fibrillation, emboli, migraine-associated vasculopathy, endothelial dysfunction, platelet dysfunction, coagulation pathway abnormalities, and inflammatory factors have been examined and investigated. for further clarification, distinctions have been made between features of migrainous infarctions and non-migrainous infarctions among migraineurs. furthermore, the association is less clear when considering the mixed results studying the risk of ischemic stroke in migraines without aura (mo) and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in people with all types of migraine. translational research is investigating the role of biomarkers which can help identify vascular links between stroke and migraine and lead to further treatment developments. we performed a scoping review of the pubmed database to further characterize and update the clinical connections between migraine and stroke. keywords: migraine; stroke; migrainous infarction; cortical spreading depression 1. introduction migraine is a complex neurological disease with widespread prevalence and associated disability. the global burden of disease study in 2021 estimated that 1.16 billion people endure migraines. migraine remains an enigmatic phenomenon that can cause striking but reversible neurological symptoms. it is one of the leading neurological causes of disability in adults aged between 20 and 59 years old, only outpaced by stroke [ 1]. therefore, because of the global impact of migraine and its potential in resulting in stroke, as a rare condition of migrainous infarction, it is important to review the commonalities between migraine and stroke and the pathophysiological features of migraine that may increase the risk for stroke. myriad theories describe the various connections between migraine and stroke. the aim of this review is to shed light on the associations between these two clinical entities and the pathophysiological features of migraine that may lead to stroke through a critical evaluation of the literature and by discussing current models of pathogenesis, updated risk factors, treatment considerations, and future developments in migraine and stroke. 2. methods the search strategy was informed by the principles of preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (prisma) guidelines for scoping reviews. a literature search was performed utilizing the pubmed database, and was last performed on 15 july 2024. initial search terms were “migraine” and “stroke” with a filter of “review”. informed by this initial search, additional search terms for each sub-topic such as cortical spreading depression, microembolism, and cerebral hypoperfusion were added in separate j. clin. med. 2024 ,13, 5380. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13185380 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcmj. clin. med.

med. 2024 ,13, 5380 3 of 13 3. theory of migraine the neurovascular hypothesis of migraine dates back as early as the 17th century to thomas willis. the neural component, i.e., cortical spreading depression (csd), is now believed to be a key phenomenon in the pathophysiology of migraine aura, and the activation of the trigeminovascular system, on the other hand, appears to be responsible for the painful phase of migraine, in part due to the release of pro-inflammatory peptides centrally and peripherally [ 2]. the latter is likely accompanied by the peripheral vasodi- lation of meningeal vessels and is contributory to pain. the mechanism of migraine has yet to be fully elucidated, but the emergence of a neural model of migraine highlights the dynamic complexity of migraine phenomena. the hypothesis of csd has arisen out of animal models and is thought to be the pathophysiological basis of migraine aura. cortical spreading depression is a depolarizing, electrochemical wave that propagates through gray matter, resulting in changes in synaptic activity, extracellular ion concentrations, blood flow, and metabolism [ 2]. one of the ways it is thought to generate migraine pain is by activating the trigeminal nucleus caudalis [3]. cortical spreading depression is a highly complex phenomenon that was introduced by leao and theorized to be a process akin to “cerebral circulatory arrest” [ 4]. it is charac- terized by neuronal and glial depolarizations which spread across the cortex at a rate of approximately 2 to 5 mm/min. this phenomenon has been best described in the occipital lobe but can occur in other parts of the cortex and accounts for visual, sensory, motor, and language auras in migraine. the first animal studies documenting cortical spreading de- pression were performed on rabbits in 1944 [ 4]. these findings were further substantiated by imaging studies including xenon-133 inhalation and emission tomography measuring regional cerebral blood flow during migraine attacks, demonstrating a 12 to 17% decrease in regional cerebral blood flow, and more recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that during ma, subjects experience a decrease in focal cerebral blood oxygen level and oligemia which mirrors the temporal progression of cortical spreading depression in animal models [ 5–7]. this process has been postulated as a risk factor for ischemic stroke in migraine with aura (ma), and although the level of hypoperfusion alone remains above the ranges required for frank ischemia, it most likely can be a strong contributory factor to stroke among otherwise susceptible individuals [8,9]. studies have shown that vasodilation does occur during csd and disrupts neurovas- cular coupling as well [ 3]. in many instances, csd appears to originate in the occipital lobe, i.e., the territory of the posterior cerebral artery (pca). therefore, it is not surprising that visual aura is the most common aura experienced by patients with ma. interestingly, the pca territory appears to be a predominant site of stroke in migraine patients: in several small series, over 70% of young migraine patients with migrainous stroke were found to have lesions in the territory of the posterior cerebral circulation, and many other studies have reported pca hypoperfusion in the context of migraine with aura, so clearly, focal oligemia can be a culprit in stroke in the setting of migraine with aura [ 10]. there are various postulations as to why the pca territory is susceptible to ischemic stroke in the context of migraine including the common fetal-type pca variant that leads to an incomplete circle of willis, microemboli through a vertebral artery pseudoaneurysm, and less robust secondary vascular symptoms of arterioles and capillaries compared to other vascular territories [ 11–13]. one consideration when evaluating the reported strong link between migraine with aura and the pca territory is the possibility of over-reporting, as visual auras are the most common form of aura, and since visual auras involve the pca territory, there can be selection bias in comparing the connection between the pca and migraine compared to other vascular territories and migraine. other phenomena accompany csd such as efflux of excitatory neurotransmitters and changes in mediators of inflammation, growth factors, and endothelial function. astrocytes, a glial cell, are involved in regulation neurotransmitters and ion levels, and are therefore implicated in csd. therefore, genetic alterations and metabolic disruptions such as fasting, which perturb astrocyte function, increase the risk of migraines [ 14,15]. beyond neuronalj. clin. med. 2024 ,13, 5380 4 of 13 modifiers, regulators of cerebral vasculature are also involved in migraine. many stud- ies have aimed to identify the basis for endothelial dysfunction which may be present among patients with ma. increases in c reactive protein (crp) and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, il-1b, il-6, and il-10 have been reported in migraine pa- tients [ 16,17]. however, there are mixed data for crp and other inflammatory markers including cytokines, with small studies reporting trends toward a positive correlation between crp and migraine with aura, but an insignificant p-value of 0.08 [ 16]. ma may be associated with an increased level of circulating endothelial microparticles, potentially contributing to endothelial dysfunction [ 18]. migraineurs have been found to have in- creased levels of biomarkers of endothelial activation. this supports the notion that blood vessels play a role in the mediation of migraine pathophysiology. furthermore, changes to vascular structure have been observed in people with migraine as ultrasound studies have demonstrated that carotid intima media thickness is increased in people with migraine compared to controls [ 19]. there may even be a proportional pattern to this increase in intima thickness as this structural aberration was more pronounced in people who experi- ence chronic migraines compared to those who have episodic migraines [ 19]. interestingly, those with chronic migraines had less vasodilatory reactivity compared to those who suffer from episodic migraines, which may be attributable to the greater increase in the intima and media thickness, as these layers are what respond to vasodilatory agents like nitric oxide [19]. another proposed pathophysiologic mechanism of migraine is glymphatic system dysfunction secondary to the vasoactive and electrochemical gradient aberrations triggered by cortical spreading depression [ 20]. thus, csd can perpetuate migraines as compounds that can further provoke migraines are not filtered out if cerebrospinal fluid is not flowing properly. one study utilizing an animal model of migraine by inducing csd found that csd alters 11% of the csf proteome, with the up-regulation of proteins that directly activate receptors in the trigeminal ganglion, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp), a pathogenic protein that triggers migraines [ 21]. thus, disruptions in the flow or absorption of cerebrospinal fluid can further increase cgrp , and thus worsen migraine [ 20]. similarly, in states of neuroinflammation, abnormal cerebrospinal fluid flow can also enable reactive oxygen species to accumulate, triggering more inflammation, and thus inciting more migraines [ 20]. it is well known that disruption to arachnoid or pacchionian granulation function or structure causes headaches, often through meningeal irritation or abnormal cerebrospinal flow dynamics [ 22]. therefore, the glymphatic system is another consideration in the pathogenesis of migraines. beyond aberrations in carotid, cerebral, and meningeal vascular structure, and function in the context of migraine, systemic vasculopathy has been well documented among migraine patients. on the one hand, it has been shown that migraine, including ma and mo, is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hr 1.39) and cardiovascular mortality (hr 1.37), and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and ischemic heart disease are more frequent in migraine patients [ 23]. another large study featuring 394,942 people with migraines and 757,465 people without migraines found that migraine was associated with a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events [24]. in terms of additional mediators of a vascular link to migraine, some have postulated hypercoagulability through the clotting cascade as a factor in migraine. there have been theories about platelet count and platelet function being involved with migraine, with platelet clots being a source of microemboli to cause the transient ischemia related to mi- graine, but there have been no significant studies to date [ 25,26]. in a 2018 case–control study, migraineurs had significantly elevated fibrinogen (316.12 mg/dl vs. 298.87 mg/dl, p= 0.007) and high-sensitivity crp (3.42 mg/l vs. 2.56 mg/l, p= 0.03) [ 27]. interest- ingly, the biomarker levels correlated with aura frequency and total number of aura-years. other intravascular procoagulant factors that have similarly been found to be elevated include antiphospholipid antibody, homocysteine, von willebrand factor, and endothelin-1,j. clin. med. 2024 ,13, 5380 5 of 13 which all increase hypercoagulability and vasoconstriction [ 28–30]. although migraine pathophysiology has much yet to be elucidated, migraine is increasingly recognized as a neurovascular disorder. further demonstrating the link between vasculopathy and migraine is the correla- tion between different genetic mutations and migraine. cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (cadasil) is a disease of the small vessels of the brain due to aberrant smooth muscle secondary to a mutation of the gene notch3. migraine, specifically ma, is a common complaint of people with cadasil even before they have ischemic strokes related to their arteriopathy, with atypical features like prolonged aura and duration of deficits to resemble migrainous infarcts [ 31]. as the imaging patterns of white matter hyperintensities due to small vessel involvement in both migraine and cadasil are similar, it may be the disease of these vessels that is a pathological driver of the symptoms of migraine, with ma reflecting temporary ischemia and temporary symptoms, whereas lacunar strokes, the most common type of stroke in cadasil, are more permanent symptoms [ 31]. interestingly, mouse models of cadasil have shown increased susceptibility to csd, revealing the mechanistic connection between cadasil and migraine [ 32]. other genetic conditions and the associated genes related to migraine and stroke include retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (rvcl) from a mutation of trex1, mitochondrial myopathy with encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (melas) from the mt-tl1 mutation, and other fibrovascular genetic conditions [ 33]. patients with melas often develop migraines, and these mi- graines prove to be intractable. in fact, there is a case report of a person with melas presenting with ma refractory to triptans with imaging confirming infarction who later required erenumab to prevent migraines after trials of many prophylactic medications, highlighting another link between migraine and stroke and how migraine medications can still be employed in complex conditions like melas that can involve stroke-like episodes [ 34]. table 1 summarizes the risk factors for stroke for people with migraine that have been discussed. table 1. risk factors for stroke in migraine. excessive vasodilation cortical spreading depression cerebral hypoperfusion oligemia endothelial dysfunction or structural vasculopathy atrial fibrillation (cardioembolic) * patent foramen ovale (paradoxical embolism) * microembolism (thromboembolism) * hypercoagulability melas inflammation * only migraine with aura due to microemboli, not related to risk of migraine without aura. 4. ischemic stroke the underpinnings of blood vessels in migraine propagation have long called attention to the similarities between stroke and migraine. aura is associated with roughly 30% of migraines, and its acute visual, sensory, or speech symptoms can be mistaken for ischemic stroke [ 35]. features of aura that are distinct from stroke include multiple symptoms occurring in succession, as opposed to simultaneously, and symptoms crossing midline. the relative risk of ischemic stroke is well established to be approximately double in people with ma, compared to those with neither migraine nor mo [ 36–40]. the riskj. clin. med. 2024 ,13, 5380 6 of 13 of ischemic stroke in mo has not been established [ 41]. despite the increased risk, the prevalence of ischemic stroke in patients with migraine remains relatively low. it was estimated to be 1.3% in a national retrospective cohort study of more than 800,000 young adults with all migraine [36]. in the women’s health study, the risk of ischemic stroke was still significant after adjusting for additional stroke risk factors such as smoking, exercise, body mass index, diabetes, and high cholesterol [ 23,41]. this suggests an independent vascular risk in ma. the risk of ischemic stroke may be highest among women aged 25–45 years (rr = 1.7), oral contraceptive users, and smokers [36,41]. there is an increased risk in active ma, defined as an attack within the past year, but not with longer duration of attack or higher frequency of attacks [ 36,41]. the risk in mo is less certain than that in ma but may be increased as well (or/rr 1.34, p< 0.0001) [ 41]. the risk of ischemic stroke in men with migraines is not well established, but large pooled studies demonstrate a clear pattern. a meta-analysis of 11 case–control studies and 3 cohort studies published before 2004 showed that, relative to individuals without migraine, the risk of stroke was increased in migraineurs (pooled relative risk [rr], 2.16; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.9–2.5). this risk was higher for those with ma (rr, 2.27; 95% ci, 1.61–3.19), but was also apparent in patients with mo (rr, 1.83; 95% ci, 1.06–3.15) [42]. 5. hemorrhagic stroke there may be an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in migraineurs, but this risk has not been as consistently demonstrated as it has in ischemic stroke. a 2013 meta-analysis of eight studies including 1600 hemorrhagic strokes found elevated risk in subjects with any migraine compared to controls (rr = 1.48, p= 0.002), and that this risk may be higher in female migraineurs less than 45 years old (1.57, p= 0.012) [ 43]. other studies have found no association of hemorrhagic stroke with migraine, with or without aura [ 44], but other studies suggest a slightly higher risk for hemorrhagic stroke for people with ma [ 31,45]. there is a relatively low prevalence of hemorrhagic stroke in migraine. in 13 years of follow-up of participants in the women’s health study, 9 out of 1435 (0.63%) with aura and 3 out of 2177 (0.14%) without aura developed a hemorrhagic stroke [ 45]. however, the risk for intracerebral hemorrhage was increased in women with active migraine with aura (2.25, 1.11 to 4.54, p= 0.024) and not increased in those with mo [ 45]. so, there does appear to be an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in ma. 6. migrainous infarction certain authors have attempted to generate a separate list of underlying factors at play for migrainous infarction and non-migrainous infarction occurring in patients with migraines [ 46]. the main clinical distinction between these two entities as per the third edition of the international classification of headache disorders (ichd-3) is that the former occurs during a migraine attack, but the latter occurs in an inter-ictal period [ 47]. the principal diagnostic differentiator between migrainous and non-migrainous infarction is that the migrainous infarction must also have evidence of an acute infarct on neuroimaging to clinically correspond with the aura symptoms experienced and have symptoms that last more than 60 min, whereas non-migrainous infarction does not have to correlate to typical aura or migraine symptoms. furthermore, imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (mri) can demonstrate evidence of acute ischemic changes in anatomically relevant areas in the context of migrainous infarction, another similarity between typical ischemic stroke and strokes related to migraine [ 48]. conversely, migraine or aura symptoms not causing concomitant infarction would not demonstrate evidence of acute ischemia on imaging. imaging is therefore an important part of the diagnostic process for migraine and stroke. classic imaging findings in chronic migraine on mri are deep white matter t2 hyperintensities, and even infratentorial hyperintensities and infarct-like lesions more typically in the posterior circulation in the setting of ma [ 13]. in fact, a cross-sectionalj. clin. med. 2024 ,13, 5380 7 of 13 study demonstrated a clear increased risk for white matter hyperintensities and subclinical lesions in people with migraine compared to people without migraine [ 49]. so, migraine is a certain risk factor for white matter changes seen on mri. however, migraine is only one risk factor for white matter hyperintensities, and more common risk factors are hyper- tension, vascular disease, and aging [ 50]. these t2 hyperintensities can be differentiated from ischemic changes related to an acute stroke based on the presence of overlapping diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient signals in the setting of acute stroke. there are different theories for the chronic imaging findings such as vasocon- striction from ergotamines or other treatments causing small vessel ischemic changes in the form of white matter hyperintensities and even alterations in resting cerebral blood flow [ 33]. however, as ergotamine use is less common now, and as triptans can cause reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, there may be a small, inconsistent intrac- erebral vasoconstriction induced by triptans which contributes to white matter changes seen on mri. thus, medications as a cause of imaging findings in patients with migraine appears to be a tenuous explanation and it is likely the underlying pathophysiology of migraine and changes in blood flow dynamics causing chronic imaging changes. shared cardiovascular risk factors of migraine with aura and ischemic stroke the complexity of the relationship between migraine and stroke remains more fluid at present, and migraine patients who experience stroke may have components of both particularities of migraine itself predisposing to stroke and factors which may not be seemingly directly related to migraine, such as atrial fibrillation and vascular disease. atrial fibrillation is an established risk factor for ischemic stroke, specifically cardioembolic stroke [ 51]. multiple studies and even systematic reviews evaluating population-level data observe a greater frequency of atrial fibrillation in people who have migraine with aura compared to patients who experience without aura, and atrial fibrillation is observed as a more common risk factor in people with migraine with aura who have strokes [ 52,53]. for people with migraine with aura who develop strokes, cardioembolic stroke was the most common underlying mechanism, especially in people who experience visual auras [ 54]. among stroke patients who do not have an aura associated with their migraines, they tend to have more common stroke risk factors like atherosclerosis [ 52]. interestingly, having a patent foramen ovale (pfo) was also associated with stroke in those who have migraine with auras [ 52]. a review of several studies found that, among migraine patients, the incidence of pfo is 46.3–88% in migraine patients with aura compared with 16.2–34.9% in migraine patients without aura. those who have migraine without aura do not appear to have a significantly higher prevalence of pfo in comparison to the general population [ 55]. therefore, having a pfo is a risk factor for both migraine with aura and for stroke. this finding, along with other data, further demonstrates how embolism causing temporary ischemia, a common theory behind the negative symptoms associated with an aura, is implicated in both migraine with aura for temporary symptoms and migrainous infarction when negative symptoms persist because of stroke [ 53,54,56]. to provide more mechanistic insight, a mouse model revealed that microembolism induces csd, revealing that the principal pathologic process of ma is triggered by emboli [ 57]. this association between embolism and migraine with aura, along with the certain link between embolism and stroke, further demonstrates the relationship between migraine with aura and stroke, and why migraine without aura is less associated with stroke or migrainous infarction. due to the known alterations in the size of blood vessels during migraines, oligemia and vasospasm could be factors in migrainous infarction. the driver of oligemia, or aberrant blood flow in the context of migraines, is cortical spreading depression as changes in brain activity lead to proportional changes in cerebral blood flow because of shifting metabolic demand. as these alterations in cortical activity do not respect vascular territories, there are many vessels involved in the subsequent oligemia. therefore, oligemia is not a likely cause of infarction unless a patient is already predisposed, such as from a genetic condition that alters many blood vessels. in fact, most ischemic lesions in the context of migrainej. clin. med. 2024 ,13, 5380 8 of 13 only involve one vessel. this indicates that unless someone has a pre-existing significant stenosis or abnormal vasculature, changes in blood flow are only capable of causing a stroke if there is a structural abnormality rather than a dynamic flow abnormality. however, this primarily applies to large vessel strokes, as the genetic small vessel disorders and imaging findings of small vessel disease demonstrate that flow dynamics of small vessels are a separate pathological process of migrainous infarction if there is a lacunar infarct. 7. treatment acute migraines can be treated in a variety of ways. ergotamines, which are cur- rently far less prescribed for the acute treatment of migraine, have been used since 1926 and were the only specific abortive migraine medication available for decades [ 58]. their anti-migraine effect is thought to be achieved by inducing vasoconstriction through 5ht- 1-b and 5ht-1d receptors on extracranial blood vessels. they also activate other 5-ht1 subtypes, dopamine, and noradrenaline receptors, which are responsible for side effects including hypertension and vasoconstriction [ 59]. due to their vasoconstrictor effect, ergo- tamines are contraindicated in coronary artery disease, stroke, uncontrolled hypertension, and peripheral vascular disorders. a 2014 systemic review of observational studies in- vestigating cardiovascular risk found that the intense consumption of ergotamines may be associated with an increased risk of serious ischemic complications (or 2.28, 95% ci 1.18–4.41) [60]. therefore, in current clinical practice, ergotamines have fallen out of favor with the development of alternative medications. triptans are a class of abortive migraine medications with a more targeted mechanism of action and a somewhat better safety profile than ergotamines. they act as selective agonists toward serotonin 5ht-1b and 5ht-1d receptors on extracranial blood vessels innervated by the sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, causing vasoconstriction and inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides by trigeminal terminals and thus nociceptive transmission [ 61]. like ergotamines, their mechanism of action theoretically contraindicates use in patients with ischemic heart disease, history of myocardial infarction (mi), or stroke, and use is cautioned in patients with vascular risk factors. however, triptan treatment has not been shown in studies to consistently increase the risk of stroke. a 2004 observational cohort study of 63,575 migraine patients found no association between triptan prescription and stroke (hr 1.13, ci 0.78–1.75) or mi (hr 0.93, 95% ci 0.60–1.43) [ 62]. in a 2024 case-crossover study of 429,612 individuals, triptan prescription redemption was associated with a higher risk of ischemic events (mi or 3.3 95% ci 1.0–10.9, ischemic stroke or 3.2 ci 1.3–8.1), but case patients had a median age of 60 years old with a high-risk cardiovascular profile [ 63]. for patients with low cardiovascular risk, the risk of an ischemic event after triptan initiation was very low, and the study concluded that risk for individual users was very low. the development of newer migraine drugs has sought to expand safe and effective treatment options with drugs with non-vasoconstricting mechanisms of actions. lasmiditan selectively targets 5-ht1f inhibitory receptors on central and peripheral trigeminal neurons, decreasing neuropeptide release and inhibiting pain pathways [ 64]. there was no statistical difference in the frequency of cardiovascular treatment-emergent adverse effects in its phase three trial [ 64]. calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp) blockade is another new development in migraine treatment, which works through receptor or molecule antagonism. cgrp is a neuropeptide released from perivascular nerve fibers after trigeminal nerve activation [ 65]. animal models demonstrate a vasodilatory effect of cgrp , which is likely a way it is implicated in migraine [ 66]. anti-cgrp drugs have not been shown to have an increased risk of adverse cerebrovascular events either [ 67,68]. furthermore, erenumab and fremanezumab are monoclonal antibodies that block cgrp and are effective for migraine prophylaxis. while there are mixed data on erenumab-induced hypertension, with most indications suggesting a slight increase in blood pressure, there were no clinical vascular adverse effects in a combined review of the clinical trial data [69–73].j. clin. med. 2024 ,13, 5380 9 of 13 migrainous infarction is a rare subset of stroke with proposed pathophysiology of csd, vasoconstriction, and ischemia, but there is no uniform treatment [ 74]. in general, experts recommend avoiding vasoconstrictive medications like ergotamines and triptans, and many alternative therapies have included nitrate, nifedipine, furosemide, valproate, acetazolamide, ketamine, prochlorperazine, and magnesium [ 74]. some advocate for the treatment of migrainous infarction with methylprednisolone and hydration and even calcium channel blockers such as verapamil to reduce vasospasm and facilitate perfusion, along with the avoidance of triptans due to associated vasoconstriction [ 75]. the use of calcium channel blockers in this clinical scenario further demonstrates the importance of blood vessel dynamics rather than thrombosis in migrainous infarction. 8. future directions promising efforts in identifying migraine biomarkers have been made towards the goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of migraine. cgrp , for example, is con- sidered the initiative biomarker, as it was found to have significantly increased levels in peripheral blood during the interictal period, which led to the development of cgrp- targeted therapy [ 76]. however, despite this, there are still no validated biomarkers for migraine [77,78]. microrna (mirna) is one such area that is being studied in multiple applications related to migraine. mirna are short, non-coding rnas that control messenger rna expression and inhibit the function of proteins responsible for the development of migraine pain through epigenetic mechanisms [ 79]. they have been shown to be deregulated in pain states and diseases associated with increased cardiovascular risk, which identifies its potential as a biomarker and may help further clarify the relationship between mi- graine and stroke [ 77]. a specific circulating mirna profile was found to be associated with migraine without aura which is also known to be modulated in atherosclerosis and stroke [ 80]. another study found the similarly elevated expression of four mirnas that regulate endothelial function in migraine patients with aura compared to those without aura [ 81]. these preliminary studies could suggest a link between migraine without aura and cardiovascular risk. future studies are needed to investigate the complex link between migraine, microrna, and vascular risk further. other peptides being evaluated in the context of migraine are secretin peptides such as pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (pacap) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip), and to a lesser extent, other peptides in the same class [ 82]. the data appear to be more mixed for vip than pacap . levels of pacap are increased in blood tests during migraine; infusing pacap triggers migraines through vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation, and nociception; and there is some data indicating that blocking the pacap pathway can reduce monthly migraine burden [ 82]. therefore, serum pacap levels can serve as a biomarker for migraine, while medications targeting pacap or its ligand can serve as therapeutic targets, with clinical trials underway [82]. 9. limitations there are limitations to the methods employed in this scoping review such as the incomplete retrieval of identified research and reporting bias. the restrictions imposed on the search strategy to exclude publications that were not in english, did not have a full text available, or that were clinical trials, case series, or case reports led to a significant decrease in the studies available for review. the date range of publications available on the pubmed database from 1976 to 2024, while comprehensive, does exclude many earlier studies that elucidate the pathophysiology of migraine, so the nature of using an online database, which only features electronically available studies, is a limitation. moreover, analysis often combined conclusions from different studies to explain different components of the relationship between migraine and stroke, inviting conflation and mixed findings. the broad methodology and preference for population-level clinical data was a methodj. clin. med. 2024 ,13, 5380 10 of

between migraine and stroke in terms of risk factors, mechanistic pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management. over time, the pathophysiology of migraine has come to be understood to be complex. there is an increased risk of ischemic stroke in patients with migraine with aura, but the prevalence remains relatively low. the risk of ischemic stroke is not well established in migraine without aura. less certain is the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in all migraines. while initial migraine-targeted therapies work by vasoconstriction and are contraindicated in patients with vascular risk factors or history, the risk for individual users appears to be relatively low. translational advances have allowed for the development of newer therapies that provide safe and effective therapies for all who suffer from migraine. author contributions: conceptualization, s.k.; methodology, n.n. and a.n.; investigation, n.n., a.n. and s.k.; data curation, n.n., a.n. and s.k.; writing—original draft

1/13 https://jkms.orgabstract background: visual aura (va) occurs mostly in migraine with aura (ma), but some case studies have reported aura in non-migraine headaches. thus, information of va in non-migraine headaches is scarce. aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and impact of va in non-migraine headache and compare it with that of migraine headache.methods: this study was a nationwide population-based study. we used an internet-based headache diagnosis questionnaire to diagnose headache, and various modules to evaluate clinical features and comorbidities of participants with headache. we defined migraine headache as migraine and probable migraine (pm), whereas non-migraine headache was defined as a headache but not migraine or pm. va was defined as a self-reporting va rating scale score ≥ 3.results: of the 3,030 participants, 1,431 (47.2%) and 507 (16.7%) had non-migraine headache and migraine headache, respectively. va prevalence was much lower in the non-migraine headache group than in the migraine headache group (14.5% [207/1,431] vs. 26.0% [132/507], p < 0.001). in subjects with non-migraine headache, those with va had a markedly higher number of headache days per 30 days (median [25 th–7 5th percentiles]: 2.0 [1.0–5.0] vs. 2.0 [1.0–3.0], p < 0.001), and headache-related disability (6.0 [3.0–16.0] vs. 2.0 [0.0– 7.0], p < 0.001) than those without va. va prevalence did not differ significantly according to age and sex.conclusion: non-migraine headache with va patients had more severe symptoms than those without va. these findings may improve the understanding of va and the management of individuals with non-migraine headache. keywords: visual aura; epidemiology; migraine; non-migraine headache; korea introduction aura is a completely reversible array of neurological symptoms that occurs mainly with migraine attacks. 1 visual aura (va), the most common form of typical aura, occurs in 98% of migraine with aura (ma) patients, followed by sensory symptoms, and then speech disturbances. 2 va can occur alone or in combination with other forms of auras. 3 clinical studies have shown that va varies and is often complex, but common symptoms include foggy vision, blind spots, flashing of bright light, and zigzag lines. 4 a recent study revealed that severity of migraine and probable migraine (pm) were more severe when accompanied by va.j korean med sci. 2023 aug 7;38(31):e237 https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2023.38.e237eissn 1598-6357·pissn 1011-8934 original article neuroscience received: feb 13, 2023

association with migraine. some case studies have reported aura in non-migraine headaches, including cluster headache, hemicrania continua, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and tension-type headache (tth). 5-7 it has been proposed that aura symptoms may occur independently of the headache. 8 genetic studies suggest that aura symptoms are associated with a specific gene or a set of genes, whereas headache is associated with different genes. 9 according to those reports, aura can occur in any forms of headache. nevertheless, there is currently no reports on the impact and prevalence of va in non-migraine headache in epidemiologic settings. for the diagnosis of va, the va rating scale (vars) was used, which is a five-item questionnaire with high sensitivity and specificity. 10 the self-report form of the vars has enabled an accurate evaluation of va in clinical and epidemiological studies. 11 the purpose of the study was to assess the prevalence and impact of va in non-migraine headache in a nationwide population-based samples. methods study design this study used the data of the circannual change in headache and sleep (chase) study, which is a nationwide population-based survey regarding yearly chronobiological changes in headache and sleep. a comprehensive description of the study design and methodology has already been provided. 12 in brief, the chase study adopted a two-stage clustered random sampling data collection technique based on the korean population census data of 2015 to obtain a sample proportional to the distribution of the population in korea. 13 with assistance from hankook research, we performed an internet-based survey of aged 20–59 adults. we set the target sample size to 3,000 and the calculated sampling error was ± 1.8%. we used an internet-based headache diagnosis questionnaire to diagnose headache during the chase study. we also used various modules to assess the quality of sleep, and comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, fibromyalgia, and the level of stress. in addition, headache intensity, headache-related disability, and other factors were investigated. longitudinal assessments were conducted every 3 months for 1 year. diagnosis of migraine headache migraine headache was defined as migraine and pm. we diagnosed migraine without aura (mo) according to the international classification of headache disorders, 3 rd edition (ichd- 3) criteria (code 1.1). 14 diagnostic validation was assessed by contrasting the questionnaire- based diagnoses with the clinicians’ diagnoses by telephone interviews. pm was diagnosed according to ichd-3, as a migraine only fulfilling one of the five criteria for migraine (code 1.5). 14 headache that fulfills criteria for both pm and tth was coded as tth by the general rule of hierarchy in the ichd-3. 15 in the present study, ma (code 1.2) was defined as a headache that met the diagnostic criteria for both ma and mo. therefore, migraine referred to both ma and mo. likewise, pm was defined to include both pm with aura (code 1.5.2) and without aura (code 1.5.1). the estimated sensitivity and specificity of our diagnostic questionnaire for migraine were 92.6% and 94.8%, respectively, and those for pm were 85.0% and 92.9%, respectively. 16 2/13visual aura in non-migraine headache https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2023.38.e237 https://jkms.orgdiagnosis of non-migraine headache we defined non-migraine headache as a headache without a migraine headache during the previous year. non-migraine headache was divided into tth or non-migraine non-tension-type (nmnt) headache. tth was diagnosed based on ichd-3 criteria (code 2.1) regardless of the frequency as follows: (a) at least ten episodes fulfilling criteria b–d; (b) lasting from 30 minutes to 7 days; (c) at least two of the following four characteristics: (1) bilateral location, (2) non-pulsating quality, (3) mild or moderate pain intensity, and (4) not aggravated by routine physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs; (d) both of the following during the headache: (1) no nausea or vomiting; (2) no more than one of photophobia or phonophobia; and (e) not better accounted for by another ichd-3 diagnoses. 14 the sensitivity and specificity of our diagnostic questionnaire for tth were 78.4% and 98.4%, respectively. 16 if a participant had non-migraine headache but not tth, the participant was grouped as having nmnt headache. stth (strict tension-type headache) was diagnosed according to the “strict-criteria” of tth in a previous study. 17 stth was diagnosed when all four typical headache characteristics of tth (non-pulsating pain, bilateral location, mild or moderate severity, and not aggravated by routine physical activity) were present but without nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. if a participant had tth but not stth, the participant was grouped as having tth not fulfilling stth (n-stth). diagnosis of va we used a self-reporting vars questionnaire to diagnose va. 10,11 the vars consists of the following five items on visual symptoms, each rated on a scale of 1–3 points: 1) duration of the symptom of 5–60 min (3 points); 2) symptom develops gradually ≥ 5 minu tes (2 points); 3) scotoma (2 points); 4) zig-zag line (2 points), and 5) unilateral (1 point). va was diagnosed with a total vars score ≥ 3. the specificity and sensitivity of the self-reporting vars questionnaire were 79.5% and 96.4%, respectively, with reference to the ichd-3-based physician diagnosis. subjects with migraine headache with va and without va were subclassified into “migraine headache with va” and “migraine headache without va,” respectively. likewise, non-migraine headache patients were also subclassified into “non-migraine headache with va” and “non-migraine headache without va,” respectively. assessment of headache-related disability we assessed headache-related disabilities using the migraine disability assessment (midas) questionnaire. midas consists of five questions to evaluate the impact of migraine on daily life. 18 the midas score is calculated by summing the number of days the headache interfered with work, school, household chores, or social activities. the version for korean language of the midas has been previously validated. 19 assessment of fibromyalgia and cutaneous allodynia (ca) it is well known that fibromyalgia and ca are common comorbidities of migraine. fibromyalgia was diagnosed with 1) a widespread pain index (wpi) score ≥ 7 and symptom severity scale (sss) score ≥ 5, or 2) a wpi score between 3–6 and sss score ≥ 9 based on the 2016 american college of rheumatology criteria. 20 meanwhile, ca was assessed using the 12- item allodynia symptom checklist (asc-12). 21,22 the asc-12 evaluated thermal, mechanical, static, and interictal ca in the previous month. ca was diagnosed with an asc-12 score ≥ 3. 3/13visual aura in non-migraine headache https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2023.38.e237 https://jkms.orgassessment of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms since depression and anxiety are common comorbidities in patients with migraine, we assessed them. 23-26 we evaluated depressive symptoms using the patient health questionnaire-9 (phq- 9).27 depression was diagnosed with the phq-9 score ≥ 10. we measured anxiety symptoms using the generalized anxiety disorder- 7 (gad- 7) scale. 28 anxiety was diagnosed with a gad- 7 score ≥ 10. furthermore, the level of stress was evaluated because stress frequently presents with migraine. we used the korean-translated brief encounter psychosocial instrument (bepsi-k), and a score ≥ 17 indicates moderate or severe stress. 29 the korean versions of the phq-9, gad- 7, and bepsi-k have been previously validated. 30-32 statistical analyses the 1-year prevalence of migraine headache, non-migraine headache, and va with headache was expressed as the number of cases per 100 individuals. we performed the normality test of the continuous variables using the kolmogorov-smirnov test. normally distributed variables were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (anova) or student’s t-tests. meanwhile, non-normally distributed continuous variables were analyzed using non-parametric tests, such as the mann–whitney u test or kruskal–wallis test, as appropriate. sociodemographic distribution that was expressed by categorial variables were compared by chi-squared test. to compare age- and sex-adjusted clinical characteristics of each group, categorial variables were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. on the other hand, continuous variables were analyzed by analysis of covariance (ancova), even if the model did not fulfill the parametric assumptions because it was robust when the assumptions were violated. 33 the presence of a trend in the association between a variable with two categories and an ordinal variable with multiple categories was assessed with the cochran-armitage trend test. given that our internet-based survey required a response to all items, there was no missing data in this study. statistical package for social sciences (version 25.0; ibm, armonk, ny, usa) was used for statistical analysis. two-sided p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. ethics statement the present study was approved by the institutional review board of the severance hospital, yonsei university (approval no. 2022-2189-003). this study was conducted by the declaration of helsinki, and all participants provided written informed consent for participation. results participant characteristics a total of 3,030 subjects were enrolled. of which, 1,938 (63.7%) reported at least one headache attack in the past year. among the 1,938 participants with headache, 507 (26.2%) had migraine (n = 170) or pm (n = 337), and they were classified with migraine headache. consequently, the remaining 1,431 (73.8%) participants were classified with non-migraine headache. fig. 1 shows the flow of participants through this study, and the participation rate was 28.3% (3,030/10,699). the distribution of sociodemographic features between survey participants and the general population of korea was not statistically different ( table 1 ). among the 1,431 individuals with non-migraine headache, 954 (66.7%) and 477 (33.3%) had tth and nmnt headache, respectively. among the 954 participants with tth, 84 (8.8%) 4/13visual aura in non-migraine headache https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2023.38.e237

scores (visual analogue scale, vas), headache-related disability (midas), depression (phq-9), anxiety (gad- 7), and stress (bepsi-k) were markedly higher in migraine headache with va than non-migraine headache with va. meanwhile, headache days per 30 days, the prevalence of fibromyalgia, widespread pain (wpi), and ca (asc-12) did not differ between the two groups (table 5 ). discussion the main findings of this study are as follows. first, 14.5% of non-migraine headache patients experienced va. va was less prevalent in non-migraine headache than in migraine headache. second, the prevalence of va in non-migraine headache patients did not statistically differ according to age and sex. finally, the participants with non-migraine headache with va had more severe symptoms than those without va. our study also revealed that the prevalence of va increased in the following order: stth, n-stth, and nmnt headache. stth was diagnosed by meeting all four typical headache characteristics of tth, not permitting typical accompanying symptoms of migraine. therefore, unlike n-stth, stth had none of the typical features of migraine. considering 9/13visual aura in non-migraine headache

features, the occurrence of va may be positively correlated with these features of migraine. cortical spreading depression (csd) has been regarded as an electrophysiological substrate of va . 34-36 however, most studies on csd have focused on the pathogenesis of ma, and the role of csd in non-migraine headache has been rarely reported. 37 the current study revealed that a substantial proportion of non-migraine headache subjects experienced va. our findings propose that csd may present in non-migraine headache and can play a principal role in the pathogenesis of non-migraine headache as well as migraine headache. further preclinical and clinical studies are required to clarify the role of csd in non-migraine headache. in the current study, headache severity, headache-related disability, and comorbid conditions of non-migraine headache with va were more severe than those without va. these findings suggest that although va is less prevalent in non-migraine headache than in migraine headache, the presence of va still needs to be evaluated when managing non-migraine headache. ichd-3 defines non-migraine headache disorders in relation to the occurrence of va as typical aura with headache (code 1.2.1.1). a typical aura with headache is diagnosed when the following criteria are fulfilled: (a) attacks fulfilling the criteria for code 1.2.1 migraine with typical aura and criterion b as follows; (b) headache, with or without migraine characteristics, accompanies or follows the aura within 60 minutes. therefore, if va is accompanied by a headache other than migraine, the same diagnosis is assigned, regardless of the presentation of migraine. the second edition of the ichd (ichd-2) separately diagnosed non-migraine headache with va and migraine with va as typical aura with non-migraine headache (code 1.2.2) and typical aura with migraine headache (code 1.2.1), respectively. the present study compared the clinical features of non-migraine headache with va and migraine headache with va and found significant differences in headache severity, headache-related disability, and some comorbidities and others. these findings suggest that the diagnostic criteria for typical aura with headache need to be separated according to the type of accompanying headache, similar to those in the ichd-2 criteria. there are several limitations to this study. first, the total participation rate in this study was not high. however, we obtained our sample proportional to the distribution of the population in korea using a two-stage clustered random sampling data collection technique. moreover, the sociodemographic distribution of the survey participants and that of the general korean population were not significantly different. second, we subclassified non-migraine headache into tth and nmnt headache. nevertheless, nmnt headache was not listed in ichd-3 and could be assigned as “unclassified headache.” epidemiological studies have revealed that a considerable proportion of individuals with headache were classified as having “unclassified headache” according to ichd-3 and its earlier editions. 38-40 a norwegian community-based cohort study showed that “unclassified headache” emerged in 21.5–30.3% of participants. 40 an epidemiological study among elderly chinese individuals also revealed that 35.2% of individuals with headache were classified as having “unclassified headache.” such a significant proportion of “unclassified headache” could be attributed to insufficient diagnostic instruments for the diagnosis of headaches in epidemiological studies or the incompleteness of the current diagnostic criteria. third, our study used data from a large sample with a low sampling error, but some subgroup analyses may not have a sufficient sample size. therefore, in a few cases, statistical significance might be limited owing to the sample size. 10/13visual aura in non-migraine headache https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2023.38.e237 https://jkms.orgin conclusion, although the prevalence of va in non-migraine headache was lower than that in migraine headache, a significant proportion of participants reported va with their headaches. among them, those with va had more severe symptoms than those without va. the findings of the current study may improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of va, migraine, and non-migraine headache, as well as the management of individuals with non-migraine headache. references 1. russell mb, rasmussen bk, thorvaldsen p, olesen j.

they changed localization and frequency, but most commonly they were generalized, affecting almost all muscle groups. the patient also suffered from two incidents of migraine auras with visual kaleidoscope-like phenomena without headaches a few months after the vaccination. these symptoms were considered to be aefi and no causal relation with the vaccine could be proven. keywords: benign fasciculation syndrome; migraine aura without headache; covid-19 vaccine; bnt162 vaccine; comirnaty 1. introduction the development of the covid-19 vaccine is a major breakthrough in ﬁghting, contain- ing and ending the global pandemic. the bnt162b2 (pﬁzer biontech; comirnaty) mrna vaccine has proven to effectively save lives and decrease the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus [ 1]. an adverse event following immunization (aefi) is deﬁned as any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and does not necessarily have a causal link with the vaccine [ 2,3]. new information regarding covid-19 infection and sars-cov-2 is being uncovered every day. thus far, several neurological aefis related to the bnt162b2 vaccine have been reported, some examples of which are bell’s palsy, guillain barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis-like central nervous system demyelination syndrome and rhombencephalitis, as well as functional neurological disorders. the pathophysiological vaccines 2022 ,10, 117. https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10010117 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/vaccinesvaccines 2022 ,10, 117 2 of 8 mechanisms for these phenomena in potential relation to the vaccine are still mostly un- known [ 4–11]. luckily, preliminary data indicate that neurological complications from sars-cov-2 vaccines are rare in incidence [ 12]. here, we present the case of a patient with aefi whose symptoms, that were benign in nature, developed shortly after receiving the ﬁrst dose of the bnt162b2 vaccine. they included muscle fasciculations (muscle twitching) and migraine aura without headache, as well as palpitations, excitation and insomnia. fasciculations are spontaneous, intermittently occurring, fast contractions of muscle ﬁbers which are visible to the naked eye [ 13]. benign fasciculations are common in the general population; they are localized to a single muscle and are neither multifocal, nor progressive in nature [ 14]. typical aura without headache (or migraine aura without headache, “silent migraine”) is deemed to be, by the international headache society, a “recurrent disorder manifesting in attacks of reversible focal neurological symptoms that usually develop gradually over 5–20 min and last for less than 60 min” that is “neither accompanied nor followed by a headache of any sort” [ 15,16]. to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst case reported of the syndrome of benign fasciculations and migraine aura without headache that developed after covid-19 vaccination. 2. case report we present a 48-year-old caucasian female patient with regular menstrual cycles (30–32 days) suffering from benign fasciculation syndrome that began shortly after receiv- ing the ﬁrst dose of the bnt162b2 mrna vaccine. here, we present the course of her symptoms during the period from 12 january 2021 to the time when the paper was written (figure 1), which, due to the time proximity, might be related with the vaccine. to her knowledge, she has not been infected with or actively exposed to the sars-cov-2 virus. vaccines 2022 , 10 , x for peer review 2 of 8 guillain barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis - like central nervous system demyelination syndrome and rhombencephalitis , as well as functional neurological disorders. the path- ophysiological mechanisms for these phenomena i n potential relation to the vaccine are still mostly unknown [ 4 – 11 ] . luckily, preliminary data indicate that neurological compli- cations from sars - cov - 2 vaccines are rare in incidence [ 12 ] . here, we present the case of a patient with aefi whose symptoms, th at were benign in nature, developed shortly after receiving the first dose of the bnt162b2 vaccine . they include d muscle fasciculations (muscle twitching) and migraine aura without headache, as well as palpitations, excitation and insomnia. fasciculations are spontaneous, intermittently occurring, fast contractions of muscle fibers which are visible to the naked eye [ 13 ] . benign fasciculations are common in the general population ;

the vaccine was intramuscularly administered in her left deltoid muscle. two days post-vaccination, she experienced a feeling of hyperexcitation which lasted several days, as well as muscle soreness and increased fatigue during usual daily activities. these symptoms were followed by insomnia which continued for two months. six days post-vaccination she noticed palpebral twitching of her right lower eyelid. in subsequent days, these fasciculations progressed to the entire body (generalized), ﬁrst affecting the upper limbs (most common locus being in her left shoulder), but, after several days, they spread to all muscle groups, changing frequency and localization. the patient led avaccines 2022 ,10, 117 3 of 8 fasciculation diary from which she observed that they were most frequently felt at periods of rest; no connection with the lack of sleep, physical or emotional stress, caffeine or menstrual cycle was found. the frequency, intensity and localization of fasciculations all appeared to change arbitrarily and no potential exacerbation factor was observed. the patient had been taking 2.5 mg bisoprolol daily for the past ten years in order to control palpitations caused by supraventricular extrasystoles (sves) and had a mild microcytic syderopenic anemia due to menstrual blood loss; she was otherwise healthy, had regular menstrual cycle, normal body mass index and had never before experienced fasciculations, migraine headaches, nor auras. following a neurological examination, the neurologist conﬁrmed the presence of fasciculations and the patient had a positive ischemia-induced and marginally positive hyperventilation-induced latent tetany test. furthermore, nerve conduction studies (ncs) and electromyography (emg) testing were unremarkable. her serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chlorides and phosphates) were all within normal range and she tested negative for anti-gangliozide (anti-gm) antibodies. however, her serum vitamin d levels were marginally decreased. since then, she had been taking 25,000 i.u. of cholecalciferole weekly. additionally, shortly after vaccination, she noticed an increase in palpitations and her continuous 24 h electrocardiography (ekg) monitoring showed more than 1000 sves, so her bisoprolol dosage was increased to a total of 3.75 mg per day in order to successfully control the discomfort of palpitations (figure 1). on 19th may (127 days post vaccination), she experienced the first episode of kaleidoscope-like effects in her vision ﬁeld which lasted for approximately 20 min. these changes started in the center of the vision ﬁeld, then gradually progressed and, at one point, covered the entire ﬁeld of vision. the patient presented to the emergency department and was subsequently hospitalized for observation and a diagnostic workup. general, neurological and ophthalmological examinations were unremarkable. complete blood count showed mild anemia (hemoglobin levels were 110 g/l); serum electrolytes were within the normal range (table 1). the levels of vitamin d were at the lowest border of the referent range, while pth levels were normal (table 1). creatine kinase levels (that were ordered because of muscle fasciculations) were also normal (78 u/l). electroencephalogra- phy (eeg) showed mild dysrhythmic changes in the right centroparietotemporal region (multi-voltage slow waves with a frequency of 6–7 hz and up to 50 mv of amplitude). the brain magnetic resonance (mr) and mr angiography were unremarkable. visual evoked potential (vep) testing (checkerboard type) was also performed and no conduc- tance abnormalities were found, but a neuronal lesion of the left eye which affected the peripheral parts of the vision ﬁeld was registered. color doppler ﬂow imaging (cdfi) of the vertebral and carotid arteries was also performed and was normal but revealed multiple sves and thyroid hyperperfusion as accidental ﬁndings. the thyroid function tests were within normal range, but antibody titers against thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase were elevated (table 1). a board-certiﬁed neurologist concluded that this episode is likely to be aura without headache and recommended the patient to take the following supplements: 25,000 i.u. of cholecalciferole per week and mg, 500 mg; ca, 300 mg; vitamin b12, 0.2 g, daily. the patient had never before experienced migraine-associated phenomena and her family history was also negative for migraine headaches or auras. since june, she had been feeling pain in her left shoulder which then spread to the site of the deltoid muscle origin and worsened at rest and at night. an ultrasound, on the 25th of august, showed effusion of the tendon sheath of the long head of the bicep muscle and a small effusion of the subacromial–subdeltoid bursa. on the 11th of september, another episode of migraine aura without headaches very similar to the ﬁrst one occurred. the patient observed that she had decreased her oral magnesium supplementation dose several days prior to this incident. during each visit to the neurologist, the patient was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine, while her anti-sars-cov-2 igg titer (which she determined independently at several occasions, figure 2) was still relatively high and offered some protection, due to the fact that the connection between the vaccine and her symptoms was not known and it was deemed that the risks of potential side-effects which might progressvaccines 2022 ,10, 117 4 of 8 with the second dose of the vaccine outweighed the personal risk of covid-19 mortality for this patient. furthermore, the patient independently decided to try to quantify her speciﬁc t-cell response with the novel interferon- release assay (igra) for the detection of sars-cov-2 speciﬁc t-cell response [ 17]; the igra resulted in the value of 1441 miu/ml (reference range: positive if >200 miu/ml). table 1. laboratory result summary which includes thyroid function tests and antibody titers against thyroglobulin (anti-tg) and thyroid peroxidase (anti-tpo), as well as parathyroid hormone (pth), vitamin d and serum electrolyte statuses. blood was drawn on 10 june 2021. 149 days post vaccination test value reference range thyroid stimulating hormone 2.43 0.35–4.9 t4 103 62–150 anti-tg 33.5 positive > 4.1 anti-tpo 10.05 positive > 5.61 pth 4.84 1.6–7.2 25-hidroxy vitamin d 74 normal > 75 nmol/l sodium 139 137–146 mmol/l potassium 4.3 3.9–5.1 mmol/l ionic calcium 1.21 1.11–1.32 mmol/l total magnesium 0.91 0.65–1.05 mmol/l inorganic phosphorous 1.25 0.79–1.42 mmol/l vaccines 2022 , 10 , x for peer review 4 of 8 episode of migraine aura without headaches very similar to the first one occurr ed . the patient observed that she had decreased her oral magnesium supplementation dose sev- eral days prior to this incident. during each visit to the neurologist, the patient was ad- vised not to take the second dose of the vaccine , while her anti - sars - cov - 2 igg titer (which she determined independently at several occasions, figure 2) was still relatively high and offer ed some protection, due to the fact that the connection between the vaccine and her symptoms was not known and it was deemed that the risks of potential side - effects which might progress with the second dose of the vaccine outweigh ed the personal risk of covid - 19 mortality for this patient. furthermore, the patient independently de- cided to try to quantify her specific t - cell response with the no vel interferon - γ release assay (igra) for the detection of sars - cov - 2 specific t - cell response [ 17 ];

thus far, the patient suffered from two episodes of migraine auras (without headache)—these symptoms seemed to be benign in nature, but nevertheless impacted the quality of life. generally speaking, the source of fasciculations in bfs still remains a source of de- bate [ 18]. although the precise origin of the fasciculations in bfs cannot be located within a certain compartment of the motor nervous system, it is thought that bfs develops as a consequence of lower motor neuron (lmn) dysfunction. studies have shown that the ectopic activity in bfs is most frequently located proximal to the distal axonal branching point. on the contrary, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), the source of fasciculations is a complex upper motor neuron dysfunction combined with lmn hyperexcitability [ 19]. the key clinical difference between fasciculations seen in bfs, compared to those with als is that there are no signs of muscle weakness, wasting and brisk tendon reﬂexes in bfs. new follow-up studies involving patients with bfs have shown that bfs patients never progress to als but conﬁrm a chronicity of bfs—the same was seen in the case we present here [ 20]. thus, bfs as a clinical and electrophysiologic entity does not necessarily deﬁne a place in either the central or peripheral nervous system as a potential site of damage or dysfunction. moreover, some authors consider bfs of myotomic distribution as a form of limited anterior horn disease and, in some cases, it may be a mild guillain barre presenta- tion. bfs after vaccination, together with already well-known neuropathic pain, may point to possible (sensory or motor) neuronopathy as a possible vaccination side effect. even though it is by no means possible to claim causality, especially considering the fact that this case is currently fairly isolated in medical literature, due to time proximity to the vaccination event (figure 1) and the fact that they did not previously occur in this patient, the possibility that these phenomena might be connected with the vaccine should be considered and we currently deem them to be aefis. therefore, we decided to present this case to the scientiﬁc and medical community in order to lay a potential foundation stone, i.e., in order to help medical professionals whose patients might have similar ailments that they suspect to be in possible relation to vaccination against sars-cov-2. muscle twitching is a known neuromuscular manifestation of covid-19 infection [ 21]; migraine headaches and auras have been linked with covid-19 infection in earlier litera- ture, where it was hypothesized that coronaviruses may affect the bioelectrical activity of the brain, especially of the occipital lobes [ 22]. furthermore, a case of a 38-year-old female patient with known history of migraines that developed a status of migrainosus one day following the same vaccination has been reported by consoli et al. [ 23]. we hypothesize that it is possible this might have been an acute reaction in a “susceptible” patient, whereas a migraine aura without headache in our patient 127 days following vaccination might relate to a subacute autoimmune reaction in a patient unburdened with migraine-related issues. it is worthy to note that fasciculations and migraine-related phenomena have been reported as aefis with other vaccines [ 2,24]. to add, a case of subacromial–subdeltoid bursitis following a different covid-19 (oxford—astrazeneca) vaccine has been reported in the medical literature [25]. even though our patient had normal thyroid function tests (tfts), it is important to comment on the fact that she had positive antibodies directed against her thyroid. it cannot be excluded that some of our patient’s symptoms, at least in part, might have been caused by thyroid dysregulation. however, what we observed were normal tfts at the time of aura (table 1), as well as normal tfts in both prior (obtained yearly, during routine check-ups) and subsequent (obtained twice after the ﬁrst episode of auras) testing. positive antithyroid antibodies were observed only during the ﬁrst episode of aura. in the subsequent test (in september), they were negative. we believe that the anti-thyroid antibodies might have been transiently increased during that time, possibly as a result of a presumed “widespread” autoimmune reaction. it is important to note that autoimmunevaccines 2022 ,10, 117 6 of 8 thyroid disease (especially graves’ disease) has been observed both in patients following covid-19 infection and in several patients following sars-cov-2 vaccination [26–29]. we hypothesize that, if the presented phenomena were causally connected to the vaccine, that they were mediated by an unknown immunological reaction (potentially involving cross-reactivity and molecular mimicry related to spike proteins). it is possible that these immunological processes attack synapses and neuromuscular junctions at an un- known site (ion-channel?) causing the lowering of the action potential threshold, thus lead- ing to fasciculations, episodes of aura and an increase in sves. furthermore, considering the patient’s observation regarding the decrease in magnesium supplementation dose prior to the second episode of aura, this hypothesis is emphasized; magnesium ions are known regulators of membrane potential and have also an emerging role in migraine prophy- laxis [ 30,31]. autoimmune channelopathies are a group of disorders which are associated with autoantibodies directed against ion channels. it is also possible that spike proteins caused a more generalized immune response similar to that seen in post-covid-19 syn- drome [ 32–34]. such a “widespread” immune reaction might be revealed in the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies that were found in our patient’s blood sample (in addition to the the- orized anti-ion-channel antibodies). furthermore, the idea that such spike protein-related immune reactions as possibly seen here and in post-covid-19 syndrome might affect the most sensitive and already micro-damaged organ systems (locus minoris resistentiae )is also noteworthy [ 34]. the mentioned hypotheses are, at this point, of course, mere theories and are impossible to prove. 4. conclusions we would like to emphasize that the benign fasciculation syndrome and typical aura without headache, in this case, are aefis and not proven side effects of vaccination; we do not claim causality. in order to discern whether the causal connection of these symptoms to the vaccine exists, more than a single case will need to be reported and thorough clinical as well as preclinical investigations will need to be performed. author contributions: conceptualization—g.s. and l.g.;

disease (covid-19) which emerged in wuhan, china in november 2019 has become a global pandemic [1]. although understanding of this disease entity and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) virus itself which causes it is growing, the mechanism of the development of neurological symptoms in covid-19 is still unknown [2]. it seems that the emergence of neurological symptoms occurs through three possible mechanisms: direct involvement of the nervous system, immune-mediated post-inﬂammatory complications, and a mechanism secondary to lung damage and systemic disease [3,4]. although the main symptoms of covid-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath, one of the most frequently observed symp- toms preceding or occurring during and after sars-cov2 infection is headache [5,6]. most often, this is phenotypically similar to ten- sion type headache and is described as a pressing or distressing pain, bilateral and difﬁcult to treat. there are few reports concern- ing the effects of covid-19 on the course of migraine [7]. this article presents three patients suffering from migraine over many years, in which atypical phenomenology and course of migraine attacks were observed during covid-19 infection. ∗corresponding author at: department of neurology, wroclaw medical univer- sity, borowska 213 str., 50-556 wroclaw, poland. e-mail address:

consistently, her migraine attacks occurred about twice a month with a good response to triptans or paracetamol. in september 2020, the ﬁrst visual aura appeared in both left visual ﬁelds along with olfactory hypersensitivity. she experienced a geometric shape within the peripheral visual ﬁeld that continued to enlarge prox- imally; ultimately leading to severely obscured vision. the visual disturbance was grey and dark green in colour and gradually dis- sipated, lasting about 35 min. subsequently, she experienced the most severe migraine headache in her life with simultaneous pho- tophobia which did not respond to typical pain medication. brain mri and angio-mri were performed and showed no abnormalities. after 2 days, the headache disappeared and then the patient lost her sense of smell. she developed a fever and severe muscle pain. a pcr (polymerase chain reaction) test for covid-19 was positive, con- ﬁrming infection. after the infection, aura with or without migraine headache did not occur again. case 2 this 24-year-old female had suffered from episodic migraines without aura or photophonophobia since she was 16 years old. her migraine attacks appear approximately once a month with a good response to nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs and paraceta- mol. in september 2020 there was a sudden, paroxysmal stinging

drawn by the patient. the arrows show the direction in which a coloured rainbow enlarging and appeared in the outer ﬁeld of vision. and burning sensation in her ears with transient hearing impair- ment. the symptoms were accompanied by a visual aura in both right visual ﬁelds that lasted 20 min. the patient described these two as white spots and disco lights that lasted for a few minutes and then a colourful, curved, enlarging rainbow appeared in the outer ﬁeld of vision, which eventually covered the entire ﬁeld of vision in that eye (fig. 1). after the visual aura had subsided, very severe migraine pain with photophobia and nausea occurred, which pro- voked status migrainosus. the patient required hospitalisation and a brain mri was performed which showed no abnormalities. two days after the migraine condition stabilised, the patient lost her sense of smell and developed a dry cough. a pcr test for covid-19 was positive. after the infection, the migraine with aura or aura without headache did not occur again. case 3 this 52-year-old patient presented with a history of suffering from chronic migraine without aura from when she was 45 years old. she is treated prophylactically with topiramate. her migraine headache occurs approximately nine days a month, no visual auras have ever occurred. in august 2020, she experienced anosmia, mus- cle aches, fever and a dry cough. a pcr test for covid-19 was positive. during the infection, she developed a visual aura without headache three times within a week. the patient described this as ﬂashes of light and various movements of images in the visual ﬁeld, she described these as coloured lines bending inward and jumping grey zigzags. the entire ﬁeld of vision was not covered. the visual symptoms disappeared after approximately 15–30 min. discussion the effect of covid-19 on the nervous system and the mech- anisms of neurologically related symptoms present in patients with covid-19 remain undeﬁned. several possible routes for the spread of the sars-cov-2 virus in the human body are currently postulated: use of the bloodstream with subsequent neuronal dis- semination, infection of endothelial cells within the blood-brain barrier or blood-cerebrospinal ﬂuid barrier, use of trans-synaptic pathways after infection of the endings of nerves (forward or retrograde transport) mainly in the olfactory bulb, crossing the blood-brain barrier as a result of infection of leukocytes or through the use of the glymphatic system [8–10 ]. however, it seems that the most likely receptor mechanism is the use of angiotensin- converting enzyme type 2 (ace2) to break the blood-brain barrier. ace2 expression outside the lung tissue has been conﬁrmed in neu-rons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, the olfactory bulb, substantia nigra, the brainstem and posterior cingulate cortex [3,8]. sars- cov-2 has been shown to be a neurotrophic virus that has the ability to infect and replicate in cultures of neuronal cells and the brain. in postmortem examinations, virus rna has been detected in the brain in about 30–40% of cases [8,11]. some studies have shown that headache is one of the most com- mon and often the ﬁrst neurological symptom in patients with conﬁrmed infection. according to various studies, the incidence of headaches varies and is within a wide range: 10–70% [1,12,13]. typical coronavirus induced headaches frequently appear to be bilateral, pulsating, pressing, stabbing, dull and demonstrate anal- gesic resistance [14,15]. the mechanism by which headache occurs in covid-19 remains unclear. it can be postulated that it is simi- lar to the mechanisms observed in other respiratory viruses, such as inﬂuenza a and b, where headache is often accompanied by fever and fatigue. the criteria for headache caused by viral infec- tion are precisely deﬁned in the third edition of the international classiﬁcation of headaches, according to which, besides tempo- ral association with viral infection, headache is characterised by diffuse pain of moderate to severe intensity [16]. some authors suggest that headache during covid-19 may be a consequence of direct involvement of the trigeminovascular structures in the ace2 receptor mechanism [17]. all our patients were diagnosed as suffering from migraine with- out aura for many years [16] and did not have any other chronic comorbidities, e.g. hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and were not taking any medications other than those used for migraines. there were also no previous incidents of blindness, visual impairment or other ophthalmic disorders. after covid-19 infection, each of these patients had an ophthalmological consultation, an ultrasound examination of the cerebral arteries and brain mri, which did not reveal any abnormalities. the link between visual aura and covid-19 infection was sig- niﬁcant in all cases. in two patients, the ﬁrst migraine attack with aura was probably the ﬁrst symptom of infection. in the third, visual auras appeared simultaneously with other symptoms typ- ical of covid-19. interestingly, in all these patients, apart from the unusual course of the migraine attack, olfactory phenomena occurred: in one of them there was initial olfactory hypersensitiv- ity and in all of them an eventual loss of smell. none of them had experienced sensory hypersensitivity prior to migraine attacks. in such cases, it is important to carry out a detailed differen- tial diagnosis to exclude other causes of visual disturbances, such as retinal ischemia or detachment, temporal arteritis, transient ischemic attack (tia), carotid dissection or optic neuropathy [18]. in particular, attention should be paid to tia with blurred vision, given the already known pro-thrombotic properties of the sars-cov2 virus [19]. migraine without aura is the most common form of migraine and occurs in approximately 80% of migraineurs. in the case of migraine with aura, which affects about 20% of patients, it should be remembered that according to the criteria of diagnosis, the patient must have at least two such attacks to be able to recognize migraine with aura [16]. the visual aura is associated with cortical spreading depression (csd) from the visual cortex to the primary somatosen- sory and motor cortex. sometimes csd is not a strong enough trigger to trigger a headache after a migraine aura. in such cases, we recognize an aura without a headache [7,16,20]. however, on the basis of numerous clinical observations, it can be assumed that the frequency of aura in patients diagnosed with migraine without aura is higher than is generally assumed. further research is required to obtain accurate observations and determine the prevalence of this phenomenon. the cases presented in this report may suggest that coronavi- rus may affect the bioelectrical activity of the brain and perhaps – 904m. waliszewska-prosół, s. budrewicz journal of infection and public health 14 (2021) 903–905 by increasing activity, especially in the occipital lobes – it may be responsible for csd and successive appearance of aura. the mech- anism of this phenomenon remains unknown. these observations require conﬁrmation in larger groups of patients and with the use of functional imaging techniques. to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report in the world literature regarding the association of migraine aura with covid-19. funding no funding sources. competing interests none declared. ethical approval approval for this research was given by the commission of ethics at the

leaving them functionally incapable of performing regular everyday tasks. the global burden of headache is 40%, of which migraine accounts for 47%. objective: this study aims to determine the frequency of migraine among medical students of lahore and its characteristics, associated triggers, and relievers among medical students.methodology: a cross-sectional study was conducted in medical colleges after obtaining ethical approval. migraine was diagnosed using the criteria provided in the international classi ﬁcation of headache disorders, third edition (ichd-3), and data on triggers, relief, and demographics were collected. the information is analyzed using spss 22.result: the data were collected from 522 medical students. the average age of the students was 21.3 ±2.0 sd (in years). about 146 (28.0%) of the medical students have migraine according to ichd-3 criteria and were diagnosed initially. gender was insigni ﬁcantly associated with migraine ( p-value =0.32). students with psoriasis, hypertension, and polycystic ovarian syndrome were statistically signi ﬁcantly related to migraines with a p-value =0.002. dehydration is the most frequent aggravator, and adequate sleep is the most frequent reliever of migraine. conclusion: the ﬁndings show a high frequency of migraine. they are similar in both genders, depicting that stressful lifestyles, inadequate sleep patterns, and bizarre dietary habits make them more prone to migraine episodes. so, further, detailed studiesshould be done on evaluating triggers and relievers of migraine and their interrelations with migraine so we can focus on preventive strategies, diagnosis, and treatment of migraine. keywords: headache, ichd-3, migraine, relievers, triggers introduction headache, or the medical term ‘cephalgia ’, is a widely prevalent illness that negatively impacts people ’s lives, leaving them func- tionally incapable of performing regular everyday tasks[1]. there are many different types of headaches, such as migraine, tensionheadache, cluster headache, and frequent headache. the global burden of headache is 40%, of which migraine accounts for 47% [2]. headache problems are well-studied and relatively frequent, affecting over 50% of the entire population.migraine affects 30% of the world ’s population, making it a signiﬁcant health problem[3]. studies have shown that women are more likely to experience migraines (20.7%) than men (9%). the prevalence of migraine is lower in asia (10.1%) than in the usa (15.3%). researchers in iran reported that 6.9% of medical students suffer from migraines. according to research done inpakistan, migraine accounts for 22.5% of all headaches, making it the second most common type after tension headaches. migraine affected 52.3% of pakistani medical students, more commonly affecting females (85.7%) than males (14.3%) [4]. migraine is one of the most frequent types of headache among medical students in pakistan, contributing 22.5% of the total[1]. migraine can present differently, such as with the presence of aura or without aura. various causes of migraine include animbalanced diet, neuro-endocrine function disorders, hormonal dysfunction, genetic predisposition, and environmental stress [5,6]. many studies have been conducted to discover the aggravating factors for migraine without any conclusive evidence[7]. stress,highlights this study comprehends that the frequency of migraine is similar in both genders. it depicts the stressful lifestyle, inadequate sleep patterns, and bizarre dietary habits, which make them more prone tohave episodes of migraine attack. acentral park medical college,bshalamar medical and dental college, lahore, cmaroof international hospital, islamabad anddhealth

exhaustion, and exposure to bright sunlight have been cited as the most common triggering factors for migraine; menstruation is an additional triggering factor for females[8,9]. inadequate nutritional intake, fasting, and dehydration, not noticed by migraine sufferers, are other causes for initiating migraine[10]. weather is another aggravating factor for migraine; the bright summer sunlight triggers migraine more than the winter sunlight[11,12]. migraine patients can relieve their attacks by sleeping through them, taking hot showers, drinking lots of water or eating fatty foods, or using over-the-counter and pre- scribed painkillers[13]. medical students are more prone to migraines, particularly those ranging from 18 to 25 years old. this is considered a sig- niﬁcant health problem among students due to its negative inﬂuence on their academic performance, daily activities, and quality of life. the student lifestyle, including long workinghours, studying, and sleep deprivation, has been linked to fatigue, stress, and anxiety, common triggers for migraine attacks. medical students are considered part of a particular group due to the heavy study load and long years of education. however, in surveys conducted in pakistan, the most frequent age group suf- fering from migraine is 40 –49 years [1,2,14]. this study aims to determine the frequency of migraine among medical students of lahore and assess their characteristics, associated triggers, and relievers among medical students. the identi ﬁcation of causes would also aid in determining whether or not there is a correla- tion between the frequency of attacks of migraines and the identi ﬁed triggers. since there are so few previous studies on migraine in pakistan, this one has the potential to both increase the understanding of the condition and open the door to future studies[15]. materials and methodology subject and study design the cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate students collaborating with medical colleges from may 2022 to july 2022. a total of 522 questionnaires were distributed at random; all participants were given verbal information about the study ’s goal prior to their participation, which was entirely voluntary. according to the international classi ﬁcation of headache disorders, third edition (ichd-3) criteria, 146 (28.0%) of the 522 medical students completed and returned the questionnaire. there was a 100% response rate. participants were eligible provided they were registered medical students enrolled in a 5-year medical school program. the research included college students who had suffered from migraines for at least a year prior to enrollment. using diagnostic criteria established by the international headache society, these individuals were classi ﬁed as suffering from migraines, tension- type headaches, or migraine-like headaches. the symptoms of migraine include pounding head pain that lasts for 4 –72 h, vomiting and nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and phonophobia. students with comorbid conditions such as dental disease, history of fever or sinusitis with headache, and pre-diagnosed with epilepsy or other mental diseases were excluded. prior written informed consent was obtained from all the volunteers, and con ﬁdentiality was strictly assured. theinstitutional review board obtained ethical approval (cpmc/ irb-no/1335). our work has been reported per the strocsscriteria [16]. diagnostic tools and criteria the ichd-3 describes migraine as ‘recurring attacks of uni- lateral, throbbing headache that lasts from 4 to 72 hours, mod-erate to severe intensity, aggravated by regular physical activities and associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia ’ [17]. for the screening of migraines according to ichd-3 criteria in students, a brief history questionnaire was formed and approved by faculty members of the neurology department. the ﬁnal diagnosis of migraine was made based on the visual analoguescale (vas) score and the medical professional ’s diagnosis. the standard horizontal vas of 100 mm was compared to a vertical vas of 33.3 mm. the anchoring points on the vas were ‘no pain ’ on the left side/bottom and ‘worst imagined agony ’on the right side/top. patients completed the vas four times in the following order: vertically, horizontally vertical, and horizontal. patients were not permitted to see previously completed vas assessments.the vertical vas was integrated into a headache diary (fig. 1).between tests on the same scale, a time gap of around 2 min was employed. data collection the questionnaires were employed in english as all the partici- pants were well versed in english, and the questionnaires were ﬁlled in the presence of a medical researcher to avoid ambiguity. additional data were obtained from migraineurs to identify the frequency of migraine, their triggers, and the severity of their impact on everyday life. students were approached using an already constructed, structured questionnaire that coveredsociodemographic information, migraine symptoms, and possi-ble triggers. the effect of migraine on migraineurs ’daily lives was evaluated using the validated migraine disability assessment scale (midas), which consists of three questions about days oflost productivity in the previous 3 months. the total number ofdays matched one of four categories: no disability, moderate disability, mild disability, and severe disability. in addition, the vas for pain was also used to measure the severity of pain inmigraines. a ﬁrst research structure was created based on critical stages identi ﬁed by patient researchers in the migraine knowl- edge. through a mutual learning process, this was subsequently changed into a concentrated dialog, with two clinical researcherscollaborating to interview each participant for 10 –15 min. the interviews were conducted at a health center, with the gp researcher on hand to provide assistance as required. the inter- views were recorded but not transcribed. following each inter-view, there was a debrief, which was followed by a procedureinvolving consensus qualitative data analysis at a later date. the questionnaire consisted of three sections: section 1 had demographic and basic information such as age, gender, family history of any comorbidities, drugs use or abuse, and ﬁtness status, while section 2 comprised history questions for migraine screening. in section 3, questions regarding their knowledge of their headache, aggravating factors, and relieving factorswere asked.liaquat et al. annals of medicine & surgery (2024) annals of medicine & surgery 104 downloaded from http://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery by

statistical package for social science (spss) version 22.0. continuousdata were displayed as the mean ±standard deviation, while the categorical and nominal data were presented as frequenciesand percentages. statistical approaches for both descriptiveand analytical purposes were used. for the reporting ofdemographic data and the prevalence of migraine headache,descriptive statistics such as percentage mean and standarddeviation were used. tables were also utilized to present data.to discover variables linked with migraine headaches, binarylogistic regression was utilized. variables having a p-value less than 0.25 were chosen for multivariate analysis. multiplelogistic regression models were constructed to account for anyconfounder effects, and lastly, the factors with an independentconnection to migraine headache were selected based on the adjusted odds ratio (aor) [95% con ﬁdence interval (ci)], and chi-square was employed as the signi ﬁcance test at a 95% ci, and associations were shown using p-values less than0.05, which were considered signi ﬁcant.results a total of 522 volunteers participated in this research work, male (n=190) and female ( n=332), whose ages were between 18 years and 25 years, with an average age of 21 (sd 2.041)years. the data were collected from 522 medical students. thestudents had an average age of 21.3 ±2.0 sd (in years). the maximum age was 25 years, while the lowest age was 18 years.the participants ’average age was 21 years. the percentage of male participants was 190 (36.4%), with the remainder 332(63.6%) being female. the response rate was 100%. the ichd-3 criteria were used to observe the incidence of migraine among medical students. about 146 (28.0%) medical students have migraines, according to ichd-3 standards. theremaining 376 (72.0%) were found to have no migraine. participants ’demographics, including school, student year, and medical and medication information, are shown in table 1. other factors of migraine include drinks, stress, sensory sti- muli, sleep changes, physical characteristics, weather changes, and medications. the chi-square association test was used to test the independence of

p-value =0.32). migraine, diabetes, psoriasis, hyper- tension, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) were all linked to a family history of migraines, with a p-value equal to 0.006. students with psoriasis, hypertension, and pcos were statistically signi ﬁcantly associated with migraine with a p-value =0.002 (table 2). the correlation between migraine and other disorders was analyzed using a chi-squared association test. vision alterations were signi ﬁcantly associated with migraine ( p-value =0.000). students with pricking, itching, and numbness on one side werestatistically signi ﬁcantly related to migraines with p-value =0.005 and p-value =0.000. weak sensation on one side was insignif- icantly associated with migraine ( p-value =0.128). vision alteration was the most common issue among students with migraines. pricking or itching was the least common issue withmigraine and was not affected by demographics (table 3). when confounding variables are taken into account, it is found that the presence of family history of migraine (aor =3.06; 95% ci: 2.03 –4.63), functional gastrointestinal disorders (aor =3.30; 95% ci: 1.07 –10.11), female gender (aor =2.74; 95% ci: 1.73 –4.33), and enrollment in the third year of university studies are the top predictors of migraine headaches (table 4). the most common aggravating factor for migraine was dehydration, followed by lack of sleep, stress, not eating on time, and fatigue (fig. 2). the most commonly adopted mechanism for relieving migraine was adequate sleep followed by medication, dim light, massage, and drinking hot/cold beverages (fig. 3). discussion migraine pain accounts for 1.4% of all neurological and beha- vioral diseases. it was stated that the predicted lifetime prevalence of migraine ranged from 12% to 18%[2].the ichd-3 has established a standard criterion for the accurate diagnosis of migraine. the current study focused on the frequency of migraine in the population of medical students and the sociodemographic, aggravating, and relieving factors asso-ciated with it. the study revealed several ﬁndings; some were coherent with other studies, while others were not. of the total 522 medical students, the average age was 21.93, and the median was 21 (in years). the maximum age is 25 and the minimum is 18 years. the incidence of migraine among the stu- dents was 28%. however, headache and migraine are age-relatedin previous research and more common in the age group of 40–49 years [2]. out of the total students of migraine, majority were females. the results revealed insigni ﬁcant differences between males and females in migraine. however, prior studies revealed signi ﬁcant migraine differences between males and females[18]. the higher frequency of migraine in women is asso- ciated with genetics, according to the work of reinal shyti et al.[19]. there is evidence that female sex hormones are a sig- niﬁcant factor that promotes the risk of migraine in females[20]. our participants had a 28% prevalence of migraine headaches, consistent with recent studies from kuwait, the united states, and india that are comparable in design[21]. however, other studies conducted in iran, turkey, and nigeria found signi ﬁcantly lower percentages. conversely, peshawar, pakistan, recorded a greater frequency[22]. the causes of these inequalities may include cul- tural differences between nations, variations in the timing of their academic pursuits, levels of academic stress, and migraine detection tools. according to the ﬁndings from kuwait and pakistan, the average number of attacks of migraines in the cur- rent study was 4.6 per month. as far as the factor of family history is concerned, there is a low prevalence of migraine among people who have migraine. it is not consistent with genetic studies that showed a strong correlationtable 1 information on participants ’demographics school study year medical and medication information frequency n(%) neurology

cases and participants ’ unawareness about their corresponding family history inpakistan. the literature on migraine shows several comorbiditiesassociated with it, including cardiovascular disorders and psoriasis [24]. similarly, the current study showed a signi ﬁcant association between migraine and past family history of comor-bidity, such as hypertension, psoriasis, and migraine. our research has various issues associated with migraines, such as vision alteration, pricking, itching, numbness, and weaksensation on one side of the body. the visual disturbance in migraine patients is due to reduced blood ﬂow to central retinal and posterior ciliary arteries, which causes decreased ocularperfusion [25]. moreover, numbness of one side of the body, that is hemiplegia in migraine, has a genetic association[26]. multiple aggravating migraine factors include dehydration, stress, lack of sleep, inappropriate diet, and fatigue. dehydration is the most common in our study (fig. 2), which is consistent withmany other studies [26,27]. stress is the second most triggering factor of migraine. however, besides being an aggravating factor, the stress level increases due to the pain phase of migraine[28].a study by kelman[27]shows that lack of sleep contributes to the aggravation of migraine attacks. moreover, many psychiatric comorbidities, including stress, are associated with migraine[29]. the least common factors were inappropriate diet and fatigue, which may vary in different individuals. these factors do not necessarily remain consistentthroughout life and may vary from person to person. according to our ﬁndings, stress and sleep disruption were the most frequently reported triggers in results from kuwait andindia [30]. smoking was also identi ﬁed as a migraine trigger by around 16% of migraineurs, which aligns with ﬁndings from spain[31].to cope with migraine, adequate sleep and medication were the most common strategies adopted by most of the respondents. drinking hot or cold beverages was the least common way ofrelieving migraine headaches. limitations of the study this is the ﬁrst research to assess the prevalence, awareness, and effect of migraine among lahore university students. there are, however, signi ﬁcant limitations to this study. a memory bias might be introduced by using a self-administered questionnaire.furthermore, analgesic medication ’s role in relieving migraines must be better investigated. again, since this is not a population-based study, there needs to be more clarity on how far our resultsmay be applied. the convenient sampling method was used; most of the respondents were female. in this study, we did not distinguish between migraine with aura and without auras. these factorsmay limit the validity of our results to the whole population.recall bias may be present in our study that participants couldnot recall the triggers and relievers at the time of response. conclusion the study comprehends the general estimate of informationabout patients and their frequency, aggravating factors, andrelieving factors of migraine among medical students of lahore.our study shows that the frequency of migraine is higher infemales. it also depicts that stressful lifestyles, inadequate sleeppatterns, and bizarre dietary habits make them more prone tomigraine attacks. further detailed studies should be done onevaluating triggers and relievers of migraine and their interrela-tions with migraine in a particular context to students ’lives. therefore, we can focus on preventive strategies, diagnosis, andtreatment of migraine. for patients to appreciate the need for good migraine therapy, a global education effort may be required. informing patients about the condition through educational programs is not only animportant step in the treatment of migraine episodes, but it alsolowers migraine disability. ethical approval ethical approval (cpmc/irb-no/1335) was obtained from theinstitutional

ease with paroxysmal and recurrent characters. it reduces patients’ quality of life and increases the economic bur - den [1].as the sixth most disabling disease worldwide, it has substantially affected humans for centuries [2, 3]. the acute treatment of migraine mainly consists of the open accesschinese medicine *correspondence: dexizhao1006@163.com †xinna wang, hongfei zhao contributed equally to this study 1 changchun university of traditional chinese medicine, changchun, jilin 130117, china full list of author information is available at the end of the articlepage 2 of 12 wang et al. chin med (2020) 15:105 application of nonspecific analgesics, among which triptans have shown the best evidence of efficacy [4].prophylactic treatment may reduce the frequency of pain, improve the quality of life of patients and prevent progression of the disease to chronic migraine [5],with which insomnia commonly co-occurs [6].as the study of migraine has progressively intensified, the hypotheses of its pathological mechanism have developed from a purely vascular to a neurovascular hypothesis, but the site of ini - tial activation of the migraine process is uncertain. the hypothalamus and midbrain tegmentum may be involved [7], and pathological anatomical changes in areas such as the gray matter surrounding the midbrain sulcus have also been observed in migraineurs [8].thus, researchers have proposed that areas such as the hypothalamus and midbrain may trigger and sustain the process of migraine attacks [9]. recently, an increased emphasis has been placed on the role of the trigeminovascular system in connecting peripheral events with central consequences; specifically, trigeminal ganglion (tg) neurons provide the connection between the periphery by expressing the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp) at high levels [10]. herbal therapy has been used for thousands of years and may provide avenues for exploring therapeutic approaches for migraine. the results of one meta-analysis (traditional chinese patent medicine for prophylactic treatment of migraine: a meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials) showed that a chinese medicine treatment is effective and well toler - ated as a preventive measure for migraine [11]. hejie zhi - tong prescription (hjzt) is a chinese herbal compound that has been used in the clinic for many years, has dis - played clear clinical efficacy in the treatment of migraine headaches and has some supporting research results [12–14].based on the effectiveness of this formulation, the preparation process and quality standard of hjzt (gran - ule preparation) have been developed [15].experimental studies of pharmacological mechanisms have clarified that hjzt significantly reduces the duration of behavio - ral changes in nitroglycerin (ntg)-induced model rats and the levels of c-fos and c-jun proteins to exert its anal - gesic effect [16, 17]. according to published studies, the pathological response of migraine is closely related to the release of related neuropeptide transmitters, such as cgrp [18],substance p(sp) [19],cholecystokinin (cck) [20] and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine,5-ht) [21].sleep is partially regulated by the brain cytokine network, and cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) is involved in the mecha - nism regulating spontaneous and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha)-induced sleep [22].one researcher also found that sleep deprivation significantly increased the mepsc frequency and decreased the protein levels of cannabinoid type-1 receptors (cb1rs) [23].the occur - rence of migraine is related to cox-2 [24] and the cb1r [25], which may be the targets of hjzt prescription in migraine treatment. moreover, stimulation of inflamma - tory factor production is also an important factor con - tributing to the progression and recurrence of migraine. this stimulation activates the endogenous pain modula - tion system. therefore, in this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of hjzt in migraine treatment from the perspective of nociceptive transmission-asso - ciated neurotransmitter inhibition based on the trigemi - nal neurovascular theory. rizatriptan monobenzoate tablets (rmts) contain a 5-ht receptor 1b/d agonist that contracts cerebral blood vessels that expand during migraine attacks [26],which significantly reduces the lev - els of cgrp and cck to enhance the inhibition of pain signals via the endogenous pain modulatory system [27].these effects are consistent with the expected outcome of this experiment; thus, rmts were selected as the posi - tive control drug.ntg has been widely used to induce experimental migraine in animal models [28].therefore, this study also used ntg to establish animal models, to observe the effect of hjzt on the expression of the afore - mentioned factors in the tg and midbrain tissues of rats with migraine, and to explore the regulatory mechanism of hjzt. materials and methods main laboratory equipment and drug management an elx800 microplate reader was purchased from bio-tek, a lightcycler pcr instrument was purchased from roche life technology, and an olympus bx63 auto -

appeared, and all animals exhibited normal behaviors 30 min after the injection. the behaviors of eye closing, head bowing, prone positioning and spontaneous activity were suppressed. righting reflexes disappeared in 6 mice, 7 mice, 6 mice and 5 mice in groups b, c, d and e respec - tively. the drug treatment groups exhibited an increased incidence of sleep compared with the control group (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). hjzt exerted a synergistic effect with pentobarbital sodium, and the high dose was more effective than the low or intermediate dose (see table 2). the drug treatment significantly prolonged the sleep time and reduced the sleep latency of mice treated with a greater than threshold dose of pentobarbital sodium and significantly accelerated the onset of sleep in mice (com - pared with group a, p < 0.01 or p < 0.05).based on these results, hjzt and wuweizi particles exert a synergistic hypnotic effect with pentobarbital sodium, which exerts a good sedative and hypnotic effect alone. see fig. 2. the administration of hjzt attenuates ntg‑induced behavioral disorders in rats after the injection of ntg, rats in group b showed signs of discomfort, such as frequent head scratching with the forelimb, increased cage climbing, and increased back-and-forth movement (no obvious tail biting was observed), while rats in group a were relatively peaceful after the injection of normal saline, and the aforemen - tioned behaviors appeared less frequently. rats in groups c, d, e and f exhibited more of these behaviors than rats in group a and fewer behaviors than rats in group b. the specific results are listed in table 3. table 2 effect of hjzt on the incidence of sleep in mice treated with a subthreshold dose of pentobarbital sodium **p < 0.01 compared with the control group and *p < 0.05 compared with the control groupgroup dose (g/kg) number of animals number of sleeping animals incidence of sleep (%) control (a) – 12 0 0 wuweizi granules (b) 9.36 12 6* 50.00 high-dose hjzt (c) 9.36 12 7** 58.33 intermediate-dose hjzt (d) 4.68 12 6* 50.00 low-dose hjzt (e) 2.34 12 5* 41.67 ctrl wwz 9.36 4.68 2.34051015 hj zt(g/kg)sleep latency /mi n** ***** pentobarbital sodium (44mg /kg)ctrl wwz9 .364 .682 .340204060 hjzt (g/kg)sleep time /min**** **** pentobarbital sodium (44m g/kg) fig. 2 sleep latency and sleep time of the mice in each group. **p < 0.01 compared with the control group. *p < 0.05 compared with the control grouppage 6 of 12 wang et al. chin med (2020) 15:105 plasma levels of 5‑ht, cgrp , cck and sp in this experiment, blood was collected 2 h after the rat model of experimental migraine was established by injecting ntg (acute stage of onset) and was tested with elisa kits. during a migraine attack, the plasma levels of cgrp and sp were increased, plasma 5-ht levels were decreased, and plasma cck levels were unchanged. hjzt reduced the cgrp levels (p < 0.05) and increased 5-ht levels (high-dose group, p < 0.05) in peripheral blood, but it did not regulate the plasma levels of the sp and cck proteins (p > 0.05) (fig. 3 ).table 3 behavioral disorders observed in the rats in each group # p < 0.05 compared with the control group, ##p < 0.01 compared with the control group, and **p < 0.01 compared with the model groupgroup number of ratscage climbing head scratching running tail biting behavioral change (total points) control (a) 8 37 0 42 0 9.88 ± 2.23 model (b) 8 148 59 101 0 39.50 ± 4.47 ## rmt (c) 8 61 2 31 0 11.75 ± 5.55** hjzt high-dose (d) 8 56 14 40 0 13.75 ± 4.10** hjzt intermediate-dose (e) 8 46 6 45 0 12.13 ± 1.46** hjzt low-dose (f) 8 25 27 68 0 15.00 ± 4.90 #,** ctrlm od 2.55 1.28 0.64 0.1020406080100determinatio n of cc k level /pg/ml hjzt(g/ ml) ntg(10m g/kg)rmt(mg/ml )ctrlmod2 .551 .280 .640 .1 01020304050determ ination of sp l evel /pg/ml# # # hjzt(g/ml) ntg(10mg/kg)rmt( mg/ml)ctrlm od 2.55 1.28 0.64 0.10100200300400determination of 5-ht level /pg/ml #** hjzt(g/ml) ntg(10m g/kg)rmt(mg/ml)ctrl mod2 .551 .280 .640 .1 0200400600determination of cgrp leve l /pg/m l## # *& *&*& hjzt (g/m l) ntg(10m g/kg)rmt(mg/ml) fig. 3 #p < 0.05 compared with the control group, ##p < 0.01 compared with the control group, *p < 0.05 compared with the model group, and p < 0.05 compared with the rmt group; n = 8, mean±sdpage 7 of 12 wang et al. chin med (2020) 15:105 expression of the cgrp and cck mrnas in midbrain and tg tissues each hjzt-treated group and the rmt-treated group exhibited reduced levels of the cgrp and cck mrnas in the midbrain and tg. in the high-dose hjzt group, the level of the cck mrna decreased in the tg, but this decrease was not observed in the rmt group (fig. 4 ). expression of cb1r and cox‑2 in midbrain and tg tissues the negative control group consisted of rat midbrain and tg specimens that were not incubated with a primary antibody. only blue nuclei were observed in this group. positive expression was primarily detected in the cyto -

rons and nuclei in groups b, c, d, e and f did not dif - fer significantly from neurons in group a. no obvious edema, neuronal apoptosis or necrosis was detected in the brain tissues from any group. the he-stained tg specimens from each group were observed under a light microscope at a magni - fication of 200 × . the bodies of tg cells in group a were round or elliptical, arranged neatly and tightly, and exhibited a normal morphology, an intact mem - brane, an abundant cytoplasm, and a nucleus. in addition, these tissues exhibited full, clear nucleoli, a pink-stained cytoplasm, dark blue-stained, round nuclei, intact cells that were tightly arranged around the ganglion and relatively sparse in the center of the tissue, and a flat layer of glial cells around the neurons. the shape, number, color, and size of the ganglion cells and nuclei were not significantly altered in groups b, c, d, e and f compared with the cells in group a (figs. 6 and 7 ). discussion hjzt has been used in the clinic for many years. our team found that it is an effective treatment for patients with migraine. in most patients, it reduces the num - ber of headache attacks and pain. interestingly, it is able to correct the symptoms of insomnia in patients with migraine, even simple symptoms of insomnia. therefore, we designed animal experiments using mice. based on the behavioral changes observed in mice, hjzt effec - tively promotes the occurrence of sleep in mice, extends the sleep time and reduces the sleep latency. after clari - fying its role in sedation and sleep promotion, we further wanted to study the anti-migraine effect of hjzt. in the process of migraine, trigeminal activation releases several neuropeptides. for example, increased peripheral cgrp levels have been observed during migraine attacks [29], and midbrain structures have been extensively discussed as structures that potentially drive or generate migraine [30]; therefore, an experiment using rats was designed. in the rat model of migraine, hjzt downregulated the expression of the cgrp and cck mrnas and upregulated 5-ht. we concluded that hjzt mediates pain resistance by affecting nociceptive neuro - transmitters. our team further verified the mechanism by which hjzt inhibits pain-associated neurotransmit - ters. cox-2 is an inducible enzyme, and its expression is closely related to the severity of inflammation [31].a study examining cox-2 gene polymorphisms in patients with migraine showed that the cox-2-765 g + geno - type was related to an increased risk of migraine [32].in the model of ntg-induced migraine, cox-2 expres - sion was significantly upregulated, but its expression was downregulated by hjzt, and cox-2 plays a role in the midbrain and tg tissues. dysregulation of endocannabi - noid signaling may contribute to the etiology and patho - physiology of migraine [33].two subtypes of cannabinoid receptors, cb1r and cb2r, have been identified. in addi - tion, in a study of actual clinical cases, rare heterozygous coding variants in cnr1, which encodes cb1r, were fig. 6 a he staining of midbrain tissues, and b. he staining of tg tissuespage 10 of 12 wang et al. chin med (2020) 15:105 significantly associated with pain sensitivity, particu - larly in patients with migraine [34]. hjzt increases the expression of cb1r in the midbrain and tg. according to the conclusions obtained from the experi - ments, hjzt does not regulate the plasma sp and cck levels. in this experiment, blood was collected 2 h after the successful establishment of the model, because this time point occurs during the onset period of migraine in the experimental model rats. however, a literature review revealed a short half-life of cck [35], which may explain why plasma cck levels were not detected. as for sp , perhaps hjzt does not play a role in sp , and perhaps other protein detection methods can be used to explore whether the modified sp protein has changed. he staining of midbrain and tg did not reveal obvi - ous histomorphological abnormalities. based on these observations, the behavioral changes and symptoms of migraine are caused by dysfunction, which further sup - ports the trigeminal neurovascular theory. data pub - lished by simon akerman reveal a novel interaction between the serotonergic and endocannabinoid systems in the processing of somatosensory nociceptive informa - tion [36].according to the results of our experiments, hjzt reduced cox-2 expression and increased cb1r expression in the midbrain and tg to reduce the activity of nociceptive pain neurotransmitters. traditional chinese medicine (tcm) is an efficacious treatment for migraines when administered in accord - ance with its theory and clinical practices [37].hjzt is based on the formulation of xiaochaihu decoction, which exerts good therapeutic effects on “shaoyang dis - eases” derived from “shang han lun” . the sovereign drugs of hjzt are chaihu (bupleurum ) and chuanx - iong (ligusticum);the minister drugs are huangqin (scutellaria),dangshen (codonopsis) and banxia (pinel - lia).modern pharmacological studies of sovereign drugs have reported inhibitory effects of saikosaponin (chaihu) on various inflammatory processes, and a pretreatment with ssd inhibits the lps-induced production of inflam - matory factors both in vivo and in vitro [38].according to the results of hplc–ms/ms from hjzt (additional file 1: schedule 1),which mainly contains carboxylic acids and their derivatives, organooxygen compounds and fla - vonoids etc. we postulate that the detected abundance of baicalin, which is mostly derived from chaihu and huangqin,was higher in positive ion mode. according to a previous study, baicalin substantially decreases no and cgrp levels, increases et levels, and restores the no/et balance in rats with migraine [39].dl-arginine fig. 7 regulatory mechanism of hjzt in the rat model of ntg-induced migrainepage 11 of 12 wang et al. chin med (2020) 15:105 and d-(+)-proline are mainly derived from chuanxiong, and they have long been used as treatments for migraine and cardiovascular disease [40].the main active ingredi - ent in ligusticum chuanxiong is ferulic acid (fa),which exerts prolonged effects on migraine symptoms [41]. pinellia pedatisecta is a widely used herb in chinese medicine. its proinflammatory toxicity is related to pinel - lia pedatisecta lectin (ppl), which activates the reactive oxygen species (ros)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk)/nuclear factor kappa-b (nf-κb) pathway and nod-like receptor protein 3 (nlrp3) inflammasome [42].the ingredients in the compounds also include ben - zodiazepines, which the main effects are sedation, hyp - nosis, and decreased anxiety [43].this is likely to be the mechanism by which hjzt promotes sleep in mice. the aforementioned chinese medicine monomers may be the main medicinal components that are useful for the treatment of migraine, but further studies are needed to determine whether they are compatible with each other, whether new ingredients are produced, and the specific effects of the components on the clinical efficacy of the compound. conclusions migraine often occurs at the same time as insomnia, and treating insomnia may help relieve the main symp - toms of migraine. as shown in the present study, hjzt exerts a synergistic effect with pentobarbital sodium on promoting sleep, consistent with the clinical improve - ment of insomnia symptoms in patients. during migraine attacks, the release of neurotransmitters is a key process, and strategies inhibiting their active expression may play a role in the treatment of migraine. hjzt inhibits the expression of nociceptive transmission-associated neu - rotransmitters, including 5-ht, cgrp , and cck, which may be related to its upregulation of cb1r and downreg - ulation of cox-2. supplementary information supplementary information accompanies this paper at https ://doi. org/10.1186/s1302 0-020-00386 -y . additional file 1. schedule 1. abbreviationshjzt: hejie zhitong prescription; tg: trigeminal ganglion; cgrp: calcitonin gene-related peptide; ntg: nitroglycerin; sp: substance p; cck: cholecysto -

databases from inception to september 26 , 2021, for indexed observational studies that examined either the odds or risk of migraine in subjects with asthma. the qualities of the included studies were eval uated using the newcastle–ottawa scale. a random-effects meta-analysis w as performed to calculate the odds ratio for case-control and cross-sectional studie s and the risk ratio for cohort studies. results: seven observational studies (four cross-sectional and thr ee cohort studies) with a total of 549,534 study subjects were included in this s ystematic review and meta-analysis and selected for data extraction. four artic les were considered to be of moderate quality; other studies were considered to be of h igh quality. asthma was associated with increased odds (or, 1.85; 95%ci, 1.39–2.45 ) and risk of migraine (rr, 1.70; 95%ci, 1.52–1.90). conclusions: the available evidence that supports the existence of an ass ociation between asthma and migraine is limited. clinicians should b e aware that patients with asthma show both increased prevalence and incidence of migr aine. further studies are warranted to further clarify the relationship between asth ma and migraine. systematic review registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_ record.php?recordid=185881, identiﬁer: crd42020185881 . keywords: migraine, asthma, association, risk, systematic re view, meta-analysis introduction asthma is a chronic inﬂammatory disorder of the airways char acterized by clusters of clinical respiratory symptoms. many cells and cellular elements, such a s mast cells, macrophages, and t lymphocytes, play a signiﬁcant role in asthma ( 1). reversible airway obstruction, airway inﬂammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness are the main fea tures of asthma. patients with asthma generally experience recurrent episodes of wheezing, c oughing, dyspnea, and chestkang et al. association between asthma and migraine tightness, especially early in the morning and at night. asth ma is a serious global health problem aﬀecting 1–18% of the population in diﬀerent countries, estimates have indicated that 8% of adults aged 18 and over in the united states currently have asthma ( 2,3). the global asthma prevalence is continuing to rise over the last decades ( 4). in addition, asthma is associated with many mental health disorders, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and anxietydisorder( 5). migraine is a severe neurobiological headache disorder characterized by various combinations of neurological, gastrointestinal, and autonomic changes ( 6). people with migraines may experience paroxysmal unilateral headache, vomiting, nausea, and severe sensitivity to light and sound , resulting in poor quality of life. hours to days before a migraine attack, 20–60% of patients with migraine can experience premonitory symptoms, such as depression and cognitive dysfunction ( 7). migraine is considered one of the most disabling medical diseases in the world. according to the ﬁndings of the global burden of disease 2019, migraine ranked second among the global causes of disability, aﬀecting an estimated 1.04 billion peopleworldwide( 8). asthma is hypothesized to be an “acephalgic migraine” or a “pulmonary migraine” ( 9,10). previous studies have indicated that asthma and migraine share similar pathophysiology ( 11). both asthma and migraine are characterized by inﬂammation and activation of smooth muscles in the airway or blood vessels. in addition, the shared environmental or genetic f actors betweenasthmaandmigrainecouldinducesubsequentdiseas es. previous studies have demonstrated that long-term exposure to multiple air pollutants (such as air pollution, volatile organ ic compounds, oil, and gas wells, etc.) is a potential role for the occurrence or aggravation of asthma and migraine ( 12,13). the polymorphisms of transient receptor potential receptors locate d on the trigeminal nerve and sensory aﬀerents in the lungs are an example of genetic factors that account for the associatio n betweenasthmaandmigraine( 14).aprevioussystematicreview and meta-analysis reported an association between asthma an d migraine ( 15). however, the strength of the ﬁndings was limited by the lack of clear diﬀerentiation between migraines and general headaches. this study aimed to speciﬁcally explore th e association between asthma and migraine while considering multipleconfounders. materials and methods literature search two researchers (chen and kang) electronically searched th e

in table1. the search strategy was modiﬁed for other databases. the reference lists of the review articles on the association between asthma and migraine were examined to identify articles not captured during the electronic sear ch. the corresponding author of an article was contacted if the fu ll text of the article was not available. this study was conduct ed according to the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology (moose) guidelines ( 16). the protocol of this systematic review was registered in prospero under the numbercrd42020185881. study selection observationalstudieswereincludediftheyfulﬁlledthefol lowing criteria: (i) cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional de sign; (ii) for cohort studies: an exposure group that consisted of people diagnosed with asthma and a control group that consisted of people without asthma; for case-control studies: the outcome reported were migraine, the case group consisted of people diagnosed with asthma and the controls are healthy people without asthma; for cross-sectional studies: the cases repo rted were migraine in a selected population and the exposure of interest is asthma; (iii) study outcome was either the odds o r risk of migraine in subjects with and without asthma; and (iv ) in the english language. studies inclusive of individuals w ith a current and/or history of asthma or migraine were included . studies were excluded if they were randomized controlled trial design, comments, editorials, conference abstracts , reviews, meta-analysis, or animal studies. it has been conﬁrmed that childhood asthma and adult asthma are not exactly the same in pathogenesis( 17),andmigrainesinchildrencanmanifestinways that are markedly diﬀerent from adult migraines ( 18). hence, we excluded asthma and migraine before adolescence ( <12 years) to minimize heterogeneity concerning age. in additi on, weexcludedcaseserieswithoutacontrolgrouporobservati onal frontiers in allergy |

we scanned the titles and abstracts in the search results and obtained the full texts of potential ly eligiblestudiestodeterminewhethertheymetthepredeterm ined selection criteria. the studies were independently selecte d by two authors (chen and kang). disagreements were resolved throughconsensus. data extraction and quality assessment the following data were extracted from all the included studies using a data extraction form: ﬁrst author, publicati on year, country, study design, study subjects, ascertainmen t of asthma and migraine, and results. we categorized the includ ed studies into two types: (i) cross-sectional or case-control studies containing an asthma group and a non-asthma group, and (ii) cohort studies containing an asthma group and a non- asthmagroup.thequalityofthecase-controlandcohortstud ies were assessed according to the newcastle–ottawa scale (nos ) (19), while the cross-sectional studies were evaluated using a modiﬁed nos ( 20). the nos includes the following three domainsthatassessthequalityofobservationalstudies:s election of study groups (four items), comparability (one item), and exposure assessment for the case-control studies or outcome assessment for the cohort studies (three items). the detail s of each domain diﬀer for the assessment of case-control studies and cohort studies. a study can be awarded one star for each item in the selection and exposure/outcome domains and two stars in the comparability domain. a study is considered high - quality research if it is awarded 7 or more stars, moderate- quality if it is awarded between 2 and 7 stars, and poor-qualit y if it is awarded ≤2 stars (16). the modiﬁed nos evaluates seven methodological items, a study is considered high-qua lity research if it is awarded 6 or more stars, moderate-quality i f it is awarded between 2 and 6 stars, and poor-quality if it is awarded ≤2 stars (20). the details and assessment of the included studies were abstracted by one author and reviewed by another author for accuracy. discrepancies were resolved throughconsensus. statistical analysis the review manager 5.3 software (nordic cochrane centre, copenhagen, denmark) was used to conduct this meta-analysis. the risk ratios (rrs) or odds ratios (ors) with 95% cis were aggregated for the cohort studies to report the ﬁnal pooled estimation, whereas the ors were calculated for the case- control/cross-sectional studies. the heterogeneity was e valuated by using the i2statistic and q- statistic ( 21). thepq<0.10 was considered indicative of statistically signiﬁcant hetero geneity. thei2statistic was used to establish the percentage of the total variation. an i2-value of ≥50% represents substantial heterogeneity. we performed a random-eﬀects model meta- analysisifthe i2-valuewas ≥50%;otherwise,aﬁxed-eﬀectsmodel wasused. the overall link between asthma and migraine was assessed fortheprimaryanalysis.subgroupanalyseswerealsoconduc ted according

results characteristics of the included studies as illustrated in figure1, 1,467 articles were identiﬁed in the search after the duplicates were removed. finally, 18 full te xts were assessed for eligibility among which seven studies (thr ee cohortstudiesandfourcross-sectionalstudies)wereincl udedin the present systematic review and meta-analysis ( 11,14,22–26). supplementarytables1 provided the excluded studies with the reasonsforexclusionaftertheassessmentofthefulltext. the characteristics of the seven included studies are summarized in table2. these studies were published between 2007 and 2019, with a total of 549,534 study subjects. of these, three cohort studies were conducted in taiwan, korea , and the united states, while four cross-sectional studies wer e conducted in spain, norway, israel, and sweden. the age of the participants was older than 12 years in all included studie s. among the three cohort studies, the duration of the follow-u p for migraine was more than 10 years in two studies ( 11,22) but only 1 year in the other study ( 14). for the diagnosis or symptoms of migraine, three studies used self-report diagnosis or answers from questionnaires ( 23,24,26) and two studies used the international classiﬁcation of diseases (icd) code f or migraine criteria ( 11,22). a study conducted by martin et al. investigated the risk of developing chronic migraine to episod ic migraine among individuals with or without asthma ( 14). the participants completed a written headache questionnaire and made a diagnosis of migraine according to the international classiﬁcation of headache disorder-ii (ichd-ii) criteria. o ne study made the diagnosis of migraine by neurologic specialists who reviewed the data from a medical evaluation carried out b y familyphysicians( 25). the deﬁnition used for asthma was variable between studies. martin et al. deﬁned the presence and severity of asthma based on a self-reported questionnaire in the european community respiratory heath survey-ii (ecrhs-ii) ( 14). peng et al. compared newly diagnosed asthma patients (icd-9-cm 493) who received treatment involving inhaled corticosteroids ( ics), systemic corticosteroids, or inhaled beta-2 agonists agai nst a non-asthma cohort matched according to sex, age, and index year (22). one study selected participants who were diagnosed with asthma (icd-10:

quality of the included studies the methodological quality of the included studies was asse ssed based on the nos and the modiﬁed version of the nos.as presented in supplementarytables2 , three studies were considered as high-quality ( 11,22,25). three cross-sectional studies (23,24,26) were awarded four stars and appraised of moderate-quality because they ascertained the exposure and outcome by self-reported and the comparability between respondents and non-respondents was unsatisfactory. one cohort study ( 14) was awarded six stars and considered as moderate-quality because the

( 15) indicated the bidirectional association between asthma and migraine. bu t they mistakenly considered headache the same as migraine an d included studies both on headache and migraine in the meta- analysis, which may reduce the accuracy and validity of the outcome. in addition, both children and adults with asthma were included in their meta-analysis without an appropriate acknowledgment that the pathogenesis and manifestations ma y diﬀer between the age groups. in addition, the comorbidities and medication use in asthma or migraine may account for theirrelationship,butthissystemicreviewandmeta-analy sisdid not mention that. whereas, our study made a clear distinction betweenmigraineandheadache,andonlyincludedadultsfor the meta-analysis,whichmayincreasethequalityofevidencefo rthe outcome. in addition, we added more recent studies (two cros s- sectional studies and one cohort study) and analyzed the dat a separately according to study design and multiple confounders , thus providing more rationality evidence on the association betweenasthmaandmigrainethanpreviousstudies. our study showed that asthma was associated with a moderately increased risk of migraines. similar results we re found in the subgroup meta-analyses according to age, methodologicalquality,andadjustmentforconfoundingfact ors. when analyzing only cohort studies, this association remain ed signiﬁcant, suggesting asthma as a potential risk factor for migraines.nevertheless,owingtothelimitednumberandqu ality of cohort studies included in the meta-analysis, the general conclusionisfarfromdeﬁnitiveatthisstage. the mechanisms underlying the association between asthma and migraine could be thought of from the perspective of inﬂammation,immunedysfunction,andenvironmentaltrigg ers. atopy,parasympathetichyperactivity,andelevatedneuropeptid e release are the main pathophysiological factors of inﬂammati on and immune dysfunction that play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of asthma and migraine. for patients with asthma , exposuretoallergens,suchasgrass,pollen,andanimalhair, may trigger an airway hypersensitivity response mediated by mast cells. plasma cells produce allergen-speciﬁc immunoglobuli n e antibodies due to the hypersensitivity response, which can stimulate mast cells to release a variety of inﬂammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, prostaglandins, chymase, tryptas e, etc.) and cytokines (tgf β1, tslp, il-33, il-23, etc.) ( 27,28). in migraines, meningeal mast cells are in proximity to

inﬂammatory cytokines [e.g., tumor necrosis fac tor (tnf)], leading to neurogenic inﬂammation, which activate s or sensitizes nociceptors and neurons and inﬂuences the reacti vity of signal nociceptors to the brain, thereby triggering the ge nesis of migraine ( 29). a previous study has shown that allergy shots can reduce the frequency of migraine by up to 48% in young patients with atopic migraine; a ﬁnding which strongly supports thatatopyisapotentialmechanismofmigraine( 30).inaddition, a previous study had shown that exposure to tobacco smoke appeared to skew immune responses mainly by altering the immune functions of varieties of immune cells and aggravati ng allergic inﬂammation and sensitization, which is implicate d in thepathogenesisofasthmaandmigraine( 31,32). asthma and migraine are characterized by parasympathetic hyperactivity. parasympathetic nerves innervate the lungs a nd control the symptoms of asthma through peripheral muscarinic receptor signaling. activated by inﬂammatory mediators, th e parasympathetic nerves signal the airway smooth muscles and secretoryglands,mediatingairwaystenosisandincreased mucus secretion, which are the key features of an asthmatic respons e (33). similarly, the parasympathetic nerves supply meningeal vesselsviathesphenopalatineganglion.manyneurotransmit ters,such as acetylcholine, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, are rele ased from parasympathetic nerves, which play important roles in the mechanismofmigraine( 34).apreviousstudydemonstratedthat the blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery slowed duri ng a migraine attack, reﬂecting the vasodilation of cerebral v essels, whichisaresultofincreasedparasympathetictone( 35).thus,we hypothesized that the generalized parasympathetic hyperactiv ity observed in patients with asthma might contribute to their increasedsusceptibilitytomigraines. both asthma and migraine are also characterized by elevated neuropeptide release. activated by endogenous or inhaled irritants, the airway c-ﬁber sensory nerves release various neuropeptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptid e, neurokinins, and tachykinins, inducing mucus secretion, inﬂammation, and constriction and hyperactivity of the airway, all of which are key features in the pathophysiology of asthma (36). similarly, neuropeptides may initiate neurogenic inﬂammation and participate in the sensitization of the trigeminal system, both of which play key roles in the initiat ion ofmigraines. it is also possible that migraines are not directly caused by asthma;sharedenvironmentaltriggersmayberesponsiblefo rthe associationbetweenthem.studieshaveshownthatairpollut ion, frontiers in allergy | www.frontiersin.org 7 december 2021 | volume 2 | article 741135kang et al. association between asthma and migraine such as high concentrations of pm2.5, pm10, and no 2, can induce asthma and even aggravate its symptoms ( 37). similarly, the rate of emergency treatments for migraines increases du e to exposure to air pollution ( 38). considering that asthma is diagnosedearlierthanmigraine,wehypothesizedthattheim pact of environmental triggers on asthma precede their impact on migraine. psychological factors also account for the assoc iation between asthma and migraine. the ﬁndings of previous studies suggest that asthma and mental health disorders share genet ic risk factors ( 5). asthma is associated with a 1.81-fold increased risk for mental health disorders ( 39). depression and stressful eventsarethemainriskfactorsformigraineortheprogressi onof acute migraine to chronic migraine ( 40). thus, eﬀective control of environmental and psychological factors may reduce the occurrenceofasthmaandmigraine. additionally, sleep-related disorders could be a latent confounder account for the relationship between the two diseases. in asthmatic patients, poor quality sleep and sleep disturbance are highly prevalent, the symptoms of increased sleep latency, a reduction in slow-wave sleep, and reduced sleep eﬃciency can be seen in asthmatic patients and have been objectively demonstrated in the previous studies ( 41). in migraines, poor sleep has been consistently reported both in precipitating and during attacks and physicians regularly consider sleep as a treatment for migraine (such as selectin g medications with sedative sides eﬀects) ( 42,43). many studies havereportedthattheprevalenceofmigraineishigherinpatie nts with sleep disorders (such as insomnia, parasomnias, sleep- relatedmovementdisorders)comparedwiththosewithout( 44). themedicationuseinasthmaticpatientsmayaccountforthe relationship between asthma and migraine. the β2-adrenoceptor agonists (such as salbutamol, salmeterol) are the most eﬀect ive and widely used drugs that rapidly reverse bronchoconstrict ion and have become standard bronchodilators for the emergency room treatment of asthma, and as a day-to-day reliever medication ( 45). a study conducted in a united kingdom cohort of 15,407 patients found that headache was associated with the use of salmeterol and was one of the most common adverse reactions to salmeterol ( 46). hence, we hypothesized that the series of drugs to treat asthma may be a risk factor for migraines. moreover, β-blockers are the most widely used classofdrugsinprophylacticmigrainetreatment( 47).however, previous studies indicated that the administration of β-blockers couldincreaseairwayhyperresponsivenessandairﬂowlimita tion whichcouldinduceasthmasymptomsorexacerbationsinpeople with asthma ( 48). therefore, the lack of administration of β- blockers in asthmatic patients may aggravate the symptoms of migraine.inaddition,asthmaisoftenassociatedwithnume rous comorbiditieswhichmaymediateitsrelationshipwithmigr aine. a nationwide case-control study ( n=40,477,745) conducted in germany found that more than 50% of patients with asthma had mental diseases and every fourth patient had a diagnosis of depressive episode and every ﬁfth patient had sleep disorder s (49).andthesediseaseshavebeenconﬁrmedtohavealinkwithmigraines, historically ( 44,50,51). our subgroup meta-analysis accordingtotheadjustmentofmedicationuseandcomorbidit ies found that the association between asthma and migraine was lower than the whole group meta-analysis, which could provide evidenceforourhypothesis. limitations the causal relationship between asthma and migraine was diﬃculttoexploreinthisstudybecauseonlythreecohortstu dies were included in the analysis. in addition, the relative stat istical power of the results would be reduced owing to the small sample size of the study. further studies are needed to identif y whether asthma is an independent risk factor for migraines. moreover, due to the limited information in the included studies, we could not conduct subgroup analyses based on sex , region, disease severity, or asthma phenotypes. additionally , the association between asthma and diﬀerent types of migraines was not analyzed. furthermore, we did not include asthma and migrainebeforeadolescencetodecreasetheheterogeneity ofthe data. further studies should include both children and adul ts in theanalysis. conclusions the ﬁndings of this study suggest that a relationship exists between asthma and migraine. clinicians should be aware that patients with asthma show an increased incidence of migraines. although asthma and migraine may have similar pathogeneses, it is diﬃcult to determine whether there is a direct relationship between them. more large-scale prospectiv e studies are warranted to verify the ﬁndings of this study and to provide more information on the association between asthma andmigraine. data availability statement the original contributions presented in the study are includ ed in the article/

nating hemiplegia and drowsiness but no headache at the onset. this could easily lead to misdiagnosis. with age, it may eventually manifest as typical hm. therefore, attention should be given to differentiation in clinical practice. when similar clinical cases appear, gene detection is particularly important, which is conducive to early diagnosis and treatment. keywords: atp1a2, alternating hemiplegia, hemiplegic migraine, case report © the author(s) 2021. open access this article is licensed under a creative commons attribution 4.0 international license, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the creative commons licence, and indicate if changes were made. the images or other third party material in this article are included in the article’s creative commons licence, unless indicated otherwise in a credit line to the material. if material is not included in the article’s creative commons licence and your intended use is not permitted by statutory regulation or exceeds the permitted use, you will need to obtain permission directly from the copyright holder. to view a copy of this licence, visit http:// creat iveco mmons. org/ licen ses/ by/4. 0/. the creative commons public domain dedication waiver (http:// creat iveco mmons. org/ publi cdoma in/ zero/1. 0/) applies to the data made available in this article, unless otherwise stated in a credit line to the data.background hemiplegic migraine (hm) is an uncommon subtype of migraine with aura including motor weakness. the onset is generally in adolescence between 12 and 17 years, and the overall estimated prevalence is 0.01% [1–3]. hm can be divided into familial hemiplegic migraine (fhm) and sporadic hemiplegic migraine (shm). fhm is defined by the usual symptoms of hm, with at least one first- or sec - ond-degree relative of the patient also having migraine with aura including motor weakness [2]. specific genetic subforms have been identified. there are mutations in the cacna1a gene (coding for a calcium channel) on chromosome 19 in fhm1, while fhm2 and fhm3 have mutations in the atp1a2 gene (coding for a k/na- atpase) on chromosome 1 and the scn1a gene (coding for a sodium channel) on chromosome 2, respectively [2, 4].open access *correspondence: zhongjm@163.com department of neurology, children’s hospital of jiangxi province, nanchang 330006, chinapage 2 of 6 chen et al. bmc neurol (2021) 21:267 the core symptoms of hm are headache and motor weakness. we report a case of atypical hemiplegic migraine with nonheadache onset in a chinese child when he was 3 years old. since there was no headache in the early stages of the disease, he was misdiagnosed several times. this was a rare case, and we are therefore reporting it to deepen the understanding of this disease and reduce the occurrence of misdiagnosis. case presentation the patient’s birth history, family history, and devel - opmental history prior to onset were normal. the first episode occurred at 3 years old. the boy was admitted to the children’s hospital of jiangxi province with fever (up to 39℃), vomiting, drowsiness, and right hemiple - gia that did not improve during sleep for 2 days. if his body was in pain, he could usually articulate the sensa - tion of pain, but the child had no headache attack. head magnetic resonance imaging (mri) after admission showed low signal on t1-weighted imaging (t1wi), high signal on t2-weighted imaging (t2wi), and high signal on diffusion weighted imaging (dwi) in the left parieto-occipital cortex. in addition, a septum pellu - cidum cyst was seen (this result was only shown in the mri report, but unfortunately, the original picture was lost over time). the white blood cell count and pro - tein, sugar and chloride levels in the csf were normal. blood lactic acid and plasma ammonia were 1.4 mmol/l (normal range 0.5–1.6 mmol/l) and 43 µmol/l (normal range 18–72 µmol/l), respectively. the patient was diag - nosed with encephalitis and was given acyclovir against virus and mannitol to reduce intracranial pressure. the symptoms of vomiting disappeared on the second day after admission. his body temperature was normal on the third day after admission, and his limb movements returned to normal on the sixth day after admission. he experienced a second attack 2 months after the first. the patient was admitted with fever (up to 38℃), vom - iting, and left hemiplegia for 12 h. during this episode, the child still did not complain of headache. head mri after admission showed low signal on t1wi, high signal on t2wi, and high signal on dwi in the right parieto- occipital cortex. the patient was given acyclovir against virus and mannitol to reduce intracranial pressure. all symptoms (fever, vomiting, hemiplegia) returned to nor - mal on the third day after admission. when the patient was 4 years old, the third episode occurred. on admission, in addition to fever, vomiting, and left hemiplegia for 1 day, there were four convul - sions (generalized tonic–clonic seizures, each convul - sion lasted approximately 1–3 min) on the same day, accompanied by aphasia and drowsiness. with the improvement of aphasia symptoms, the child began to have headache. the location and character of the headache were not clearly described, and the headache lasted for approximately 3 h before relief. head mri after admission showed low signal on t1wi, high sig - nal on t2wi, and high signal on dwi in the right pari - eto-occipital cortex. the electroencephalogram(eeg) showed diffuse slow waves and no epileptic dis - charge. the white blood cell count and protein, sugar and chloride levels in the csf were normal. the lac - tic acid and ammonia levels of csf were 1.4 mmol/l (0.7–2.1 mmol/l) and 44 µmol/l (10–45 µmol/l), respectively. blood lactic acid and plasma ammonia were 1.6 mmol/l (0.5–1.6 mmol/l) and 86 µmol/l (18–72 µmol/l), respectively. alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ahc) and mitochondrial encephalopathy were suspected at the time. the patient was given man - nitol to reduce intracranial pressure and received sup - plementation with vitamin b1, vitamin b6, coenzyme q, and levocarnitine. all symptoms returned to normal on the sixth day after admission. the fourth attack occurred at the age of 11. two months before admission, headache occurred, mainly on one side of the front head, with no blurred vision. after approximately 10 min, headache was relieved by itself. however, the headaches became more intense, taking up to 2–3 h to relieve 1 week before admission. one day before admission, fever, vomiting, left hemi - plegia, aphasia, and drowsiness symptoms appeared again. however, as the symptoms of aphasia improved, the headache became more intense. the mri showed no abnormal signals except for the persistent septum pellucidum cyst (fig. 1). ultrasound of the heart, bilat - eral internal carotid artery, external carotid artery and common carotid artery showed no abnormalities. as before, these symptoms returned to normal after man - nitol and multivitamin supplementation. however, as the disease progressed, the patient developed cognitive impairment. to further clarify the diagnosis, we conducted mito - chondrial dna sequencing analysis and found no mutation sites with high pathogenicity in mitochon - drial dna. whole-exome next-generation sequenc - ing (ngs) of the nuclear genome revealed a de novo heterozygous missense mutation (fig. 2) in the atp1a2 gene (p.gly715arg) classified as pathogenic (ps1 + ps2 + pm1 + pm2 + pp3) that eventually led to a diagnosis of shm when he was 11 years old [5 ]. flunarizine (5 mg, oral, 1 time per day before bed) was subsequently administered, and it has now lasted for 4 months without any adverse effects. no recurrence was found during follow-up.page 3 of 6 chen et al. bmc neurol (2021) 21:267 discussion and conclusions this case presented with a variety of phenotypes that included fever, vomiting, alternating hemiplegia, convul - sions, drowsiness, aphasia, episodic headache, unilateral cerebral oedema and cognitive impairment. hm caused by mutations in the atp1a2 gene has been reported [6, 7]. however, it is rare to report so many symptoms that are recurrent and varied in a single child. in addition, the onset of the hm was atypical because no headache apeared at the onset. he was misdiagnosed many times. in the early stages of the disease, fever, vomiting, drowsiness, and hemiplegia were observed. a head mri showed unilateral parieto-occipital cortical oedema. the white blood cell count and protein, sugar and chlo - ride levels in the csf were normal. these manifesta - tions were consistent with the diagnosis of encephalitis [8]. however, the patient subsequently had several simi - lar episodes, and we believed that this patient might not be consistent with the diagnosis of encephalitis. at this time, because the patient presented with fever, vomiting, drowsiness, hemiplegia and convulsions, mri showed unilateral cortical oedema, which occurred repeatedly. we considered that the child might suffer from mito - chondrial encephalopathy induced by infection. how - ever, the patient’s blood or cerebrospinal fluid lactic acid levels were normal many times, and there was no similar family history. subsequent mitochondrial dna sequenc - ing analysis was normal. in general, the clinical data and related examinations did not meet the diagnostic criteria of mitochondrial encephalopathy. many of the patient’s clinical features supported the diagnosis of ahc, such as alternating hemiplegia, devel - opmental retardation, and convulsions. in addition, ngs of the nuclear genome revealed a de novo heterozygous missense mutation in the atp1a2 gene (p.gly715arg) classified as pathogenic. mutations in the atp1a2 gene can cause hemiplegic migraine type 2, common migraine, and basilar migraine but can also cause a very small num - ber of ahc cases [9–14]. however, our patient did not experience improvement of hemiplegia during sleep, as described in previous reports [15, 16]. in addition, stud - ies have shown that brain mri of patients with ahc always shows normal or nonspecific findings [15, 16]. however, the brain mri of our patient showed unilateral fig. 1 mri of the brain during the last episode. there were no abnormal signals except the preexisting septum pellucidum cyst (the arrow) which was similar to that before. a t1wi; b t2wi; c dwi; d magnetic resonance angiograghy (mra); e magnetic resonance venography (mrv); f magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs)page 4 of 6 chen et al. bmc neurol (2021) 21:267 cortical oedema. in conclusion, the basis for the diagno - sis of ahc in the child was still insufficient. with the progression of the disease, the child developed paroxysmal headache, accompanied by hemiplegia and aphasia. symptoms were recurrent and mostly reversible. first- or second-degree relatives had no migraine with aura including motor weakness. these core symptoms and characteristics were consistent with the diagnos - tic criteria of shm [2]. it has been widely reported that hm can sometimes be accompanied by symptoms such as fever, convulsion, altered consciousness (drowsiness or even coma), and cognitive impairment, as well as cerebral oedema seen in head mri [3, 6, 7]. all of these symptoms occurred in our patient. ngs of the nuclear genome revealed a de novo heterozygous missense mutationin the atp1a2 gene (p.gly715arg) classified as pathogenic and eventually helped him to be diagnosed with shm when he was 11 years old. the duration of symptoms is usu - ally 20–60 min. in some cases, the aura and hemiplegia may onset quickly and simulate an ischaemic attack [17]. complete recovery from attacks is the rule, but in severe hm, hemiplegia and altered consciousness may persist for weeks until normal [3]. in this case, symptoms lasted from 3 days to 1 week until total recovery. the child had recurrent headache attacks for approximately 2 months before the fourth attack, and headaches became more intense 1 week before admission. as the child grew older, the headache increasingly affected his life. in addition to this, he only had four episodes. however, as the disease progressed, the patient developed cognitive impairment, and cognitive decline was a serious problem. conse - quently, flunarizine was subsequently administered, and it has now lasted for 4 months without any adverse effects. no recurrence was found during follow-up. how - ever, the exact length of treatment is still unclear because this is an atypical case, and follow-up of his symptoms and regular monitoring of the side effects of flunarizine will help determine this. in the case report, we found a significant phenomenon. in addition to the evolution of symptoms, the child’s mri evolved from cerebral oedema at the beginning of the disease to normal mri at the last attack. however, the picture of the mri has been lost. this is the limitation of this case report, but it did not affect the conclusions because we knew the mri findings fig. 2 a denovo heterozygous missense mutation in the atp1a2 gene: c.2143(exon16)g > a (p.gly715arg) (nm_000702) in the proband, and the mutation was not found in the proband’s parentspage 5 of 6 chen et al. bmc neurol (2021) 21:267 from the mri report provided by the guardian. in addi - tion, when the third episode occurred, we performed an eeg on the child when they had hemiplegia but did not complain of headache. the eeg showed diffuse slow waves and no epileptic discharge. however, it was regret - table that we did not perform long-term eeg in this child to understand the ictal and interictal eeg manifestations. this is conducive to our recognition of hm [18]. at pre - sent, the pathogenesis of migraine is still unknown and focuses mainly on neurophysiology, especially cortical brain disorders [19–21]. this needs further study in the future. in summary, hm in children may be atypical in the initial stage of the disease, which could manifest as fever, alternating hemiplegia, and drowsiness but no headache at the onset. this could easily lead to misdi - agnosis. with age, it may eventually manifest as typical hm. symptoms were recurrent and variable. therefore, attention should be given to differentiation in clini - cal practice. when similar clinical cases appear, gene detection is particularly important, which is conducive to early diagnosis and treatment. abbreviations hm: hemiplegic migraine; fhm: familial hemiplegic migraine; shm: sporadic hemiplegic migraine; mri: magnetic resonance imaging; t1wi: t1-weighted imaging; t2wi: t2-weighted imaging; dwi: diffusion weighted imaging; ahc: alternating hemiplegia of childhood; mra: magnetic resonance angiograghy; mrv: magnetic resonance venography; mrs: magnetic resonance spectros- copy; ngs: next generation sequencing. acknowledgements we are grateful to the patient who was willing to share his medical data. authors’ contributions hc: drafting the manuscript; collection of case data. xs: analysis or interpreta- tion of data; rw, zy and zh: followed up with the patient. jx, xy and yc: the image processing. jz: critically revised and gave final approval for publication of the paper. all authors have read and approved the manuscript. funding no funding was received for this study. availability of data and materials the datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. declarations ethics approval and consent to participate written informed consent was obtained from the child’s guardian to publish his case, and approval for this study was provided by the research ethics com- mittee of children’s hospital of jiangxi province. consent for publication written informed consent was obtained from guardian for participant for the publication of this case report. competing interests none of the authors declared any conflict of interest.received: 30 march 2021 accepted: 28 june 2021 references 1. lykke thomsen l, kirchmann eriksen m, faerch romer s, et al. an epide -

430 www.cmj.hraim to determine the characteristics of patients who ex - perienced muscle fasciculations and migraine auras with- out headache after bnt162b2 immunization. methods in january 2022, we published a case report that described a 48-year-old female patient who experienced muscle twitching and migraine auras without headache following bnt162b2 immunization. a self-administered online survey was sent to people who had written to us and complained of similar symptoms described in the case report (n = 20). results the survey was completed by 11 participants, of whom 10 reported muscle twitching following bnt162b2 immunization lasting a median of 14 (4-36.5) days. five of these participants (50%) reported migraine auras without headache. participants further reported on self-identified triggers that altered the intensity of their symptoms, such as anxiety or caffeine. fifty percent of participants who got an acute sars-cov-2 infection (3/6) experienced increased muscle symptom intensity during the acute phase of the disease. conclusion to the best of our knowledge, our survey is the first to summarize patients’ experiences of these phe - nomena occurring after bnt162b2 immunization. it is im-portant to note that no causal relationship between vacci-nation and these phenomena can be inferred. received: may 4, 2023 accepted: december 1, 2023

(aefi) were report - ed after the bnt162b2 vaccination, but no causality could be inferred (2,3). benign muscle fasciculations are visible, spontaneous mus- cle fiber contractions that occur intermittently (3-5). mi- graine aura without headache is a recurrent disorder mani- festing in attacks of reversible focal neurological symptoms, neither accompanied nor followed by headache (6,7). in january 2022, we published a case report regarding mus- cle twitching and migraine aura without headache in a 48- year-old woman as potential aefi following bnt162b2 im- munization. muscle fasciculations started to intermittently appear six days after immunization. furthermore, she ex - perienced migraine auras with visual kaleidoscope-like phenomena on two occasions (3). muscle twitching and migraine-related phenomena following covid-vaccines have seldom been reported in the literature, but have been reported by laypeople on social networks (8-13). following the publication of our case report, we received several e-mails from people who complained of similar ail- ments. in this report, we aimed to summarize their experi-ence by administering them a survey. patient s and methods this study was designed as an online self-administered survey and was approved by the institutional ethics com-mittee of the school of medicine, university of zagreb (380-59-10106-22-111/79). non-probability sampling was used to select participants: people that reached out to the authors of salai et al from 2022 (3) were sent an email in which they were asked to participate in a self-administered survey. the study design is depicted in figure 1. figure 1. flowchart of the study.short communication 432 croat med j. 2023;64:430-5 www.cmj.hrthe survey was written in english (supplementary material 1) and consisted of questions regarding demographic infor - mation, twitching and/or aura symptoms, vaccination/in-fection status, and the euroqol (eq-5d-5l) questionnaire. eq-5d-5l was employed to quantify the participants’ self- reported health using a standardized testing tool (14,15). qualitative variables are presented as numbers and per - centages. data normality was tested with the kolmogo - rov-smirnov test. parametric variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation (sd); non-parametric variables are presented as median (q1-q3). friedman’s test was em-ployed to assess the difference between two time points. data analysis was conducted with medcalc® statistical software, version 20.106 (16), and jamovi 2020 (17). resul ts case report update after the publication of the case report (3), our patient experienced a gradual decrease in symptom intensity. in june 2022, she experienced a sars-cov-2 infection with mild respiratory symptoms, during which she developed worsening muscle fasciculations and had another brief ep - isode of migraine aura. furthermore, during the post-acute period, her fasciculations were increased for two weeks, af-ter which the symptoms gradually decreased. currently, she is asymptomatic.survey analysis the initial invitations to participate in the survey were sent to 20 email addresses; 11 (55%) people agreed to partici-pate (4 women). participants’ characteristics are shown in table 1. no participant had a history of neurological illness; one had previously experienced muscle twitching, but this happened sporadically. all participants received the bnt162b2 vaccine. the me - dian number of doses was 2 (1-2). one participant did not ascribe muscle twitching to vaccination but to the post- acute period of sars-cov-2 infection. ten participants as-cribed their symptoms to immunization. eight participants complained of aefi after the first, and two after the second vaccination dose. in the post-vaccination phase, 10 par - ticipants experienced muscle twitching. the median time from vaccination to fasciculation onset was 14 (4-36.5) days. five (50%) participants experienced migraine auras without headaches. all participants sought medical help for these phenomena. the survey was filled out 321 (270-405) days after the symptom onset. five participants stated that symptom in-tensity was reduced over time, 5 stated that the intensity remained the same, and 1 stated that symptoms increased in intensity. when asked to recall the level of discomfort at the time of symptom onset on a scale from 0 (no discom- fort) to 10 (extreme discomfort), the median result was 9 figure 2. self-assessment of overall discomfort at symptom onset (recalled) and at the time of taking the

identified the following: magnesium supplements (n = 3), physical movement (n = 1), acetazo - lamide (dosage unknown) (n = 1), and “vitamin supple - ments” (n = 1). the factors that aggravated their symptoms were caffeine (n = 2), physical exercise (n = 2), and anxiety and emotional stress (n = 2). six participants had a sars-cov-2 infection, of whom 3 experienced muscle twitching during acute infection. par - ticipants tested positive after a median of 270 (205-294) days after receiving the dose after which they noticed ae- fis. none experienced migraine auras during acute infec-tion. nine participants filled in the euroqol-5d-5l portion of the survey (table 2). problems across five standardized dimensions were either slight or moderate. all participants reported problems in the “pain/discomfort” dimension. when asked how good or bad their health was today, the median response was 75 (50-80) out of maximum 100. discussion we conducted a non-probability sampling-based online survey aiming to further explore muscle fasciculations and migraine auras as potential aefi. our survey indicat - ed a non-significant decrease in self-assessed discomfort level at the time of taking the survey compared with the recalled discomfort level at the time of symptom onset. a half of the participants who had sars-cov-2 infection af- ter vaccination experienced increased muscle twitching, and the same was true for the patient we presented in our original case report. muscle fasciculations have previously been described to occur during acute covid-19 (18). fur - thermore, in a telephone

fasciculation syndrome (bfs), a subset of patients self-reported exacerbation of symptoms during acute viral infections (19). it has been hypothesized that viral infections might impact the course of bfs by triggering autoimmunity (20-22). muscle spasms after vaccination are generally considered to be mild and self-limiting aefi (23,24). while bfs may be uncomfort - able and present a high psychological burden, its disease course is benign (25). our study has several major limitations. first, it was based on a self-administered online survey and is prone to self- reporting bias (26); additionally, no objective clinical mea-surements were employed. second, we used non-prob - ability sampling, enrolling people who sent us an e-mail, usually because they found similarity between the symp - toms we previously described (3) and the phenomena they experienced, which makes this study additionally prone to sampling bias (27). besides this, our previous case report was in english, so the accessibility to it, as well as the abil- ity to contact the authors, was limited to english speakers. furthermore, the study had a small sample size and lacked a control group (which is inherent to our study design). an important point to consider is also the bidirectional rela-tionship between health anxiety and bfs (5,28), as it is pos- sible that searching for information of muscle fasciculation could exacerbate the symptoms. finally, the potential im-pact of sars-cov-2 infection on muscle fasciculation in our study participants might be a source of confounding when assessing symptom severity. to conclude, we reported a summarized experience of a small subset of people who had read our previous report and decided to contact us (most likely) due to the similarity with their own condition. it is very important to highlight that no causal inference can be made regarding bnt162b2 vaccination and muscle fasciculations or migraine auras without headache. the primary intention of our study was to report the presence of individuals who had experienced similar phenomena as our patient. to emphasize, muscle twitching and/or migraine auras without headaches that occur following sars-cov-2 vaccination seem to be ex - tremely rare events: clinical studies with systematical and objective measurements are required in order to elucidate the potential relationship between bnt162b2 vaccination and these phenomena in certain individuals. acknowledgments the authors thank the study participants. the study was supported by the bimis – biomedical research center šalata, university

symptomsprecedingmigraineheadachesandanothercasewithlongs tanding olfactory hallucinations. background: migraine prevails in about /one.tnum/two.tnum% of the general population, with the migraine aura accountable for at least one-third of these cas es. the most common aura is the visual aura, followed by the sensory aura, speech, and motor auras. olfactory hallucinations preceding the headache phase of migraine are rare. to date, the international classiﬁcation of headache disorders (ichd) has not recognized them as a subset of migraine aura. results: this report presents a patient with a typical phantosmia (po) aur a before her migraine headache and a patient who experiences a lon gstanding po aura. conclusion: the olfactory hallucination may present diﬀerently in patien ts with migraine disease. based on the clinical signiﬁcance of migrai ne with olfactory hallucinations, we propose that the ichd classify this p henomenon as a subtype of aura in the future. however, larger studies are s till required to better assess the pathophysiology of this phenomenon. keywords migraine,migraineaura,olfactoryhallucination,phantosmi a,headache introduction theaverageprevalenceofmigrainesinthepopulationisreportedtobearound12% (1). migraines are painful, recurring headaches that have been traditionally clas siﬁed into consisting of four phases: prodrome, aura, headache, and postdrome phase ( 2,3). however, people’s experiences do not always ﬁt these criteria. many patients who have migraines with aura experience migraines without any aura as well ( 3), and 4% of patientshaveauraarisewithoutaheadacheeverfollowing( 4).auraisatransientsensory disturbance that gradually arises before a migraine headache and can recur ( 2). about 30% of migraines

succession with one another(3).olfactoryhallucinationsorphantosmia(po)refers to the perception of an odor that does not exist in the person’s environment. po is a qualitative smell disorder which is often related to quantitative smell disorders (anosmia, hyposmia) in infectious diseases (rhinosinusitis), tumors, schizophrenia, seizures, depression, migraine, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as alzheimer’s disease or parkinson’s disease ( 5–7). although cases of olfactory hallucinations and their association with migraines have been reported since 1895 ( 8), po is not currentlyclassiﬁedasatypeofmigraineaura( 9).poisestimated tooccurinabout0.1%ofadultswhoexperiencemigraines( 6,9). however, the prevalence is likely higher because patients do not consider olfaction a pivotal part of migraines. additionally, the majority of case reports that have explained po as a noted aura for their patients’ migraines have always described their hallucination to occur before the migraine headache. in this report, we explain a similar patient who experiences po aura before her migraine headache, as well as a patient who experiencespoasalong-standingaurathatlastsforseveraldays

migraines ( 2). the pathophysiology of how migraines with aura arise has been extensively studied in animal models and is strongly believed to involve cortical spreadingdepression(csd)oftheneuronsandgliainthebrain. while csd has mainly modeled how visual aura in migraines comes about, it is believed that the physiology of csd plays a similar role in all types of migraine aura ( 10). therefore, the treatment strategies for migraines, regardless of their aura, are likely similar. in our two patient cases, the second patient had a visual aura that preceded her migraines. in contrast, the ﬁrst patient did not have any classic presentations of aura with her headaches. however, both patients did experience olfactory hallucinations of cigarette smoke for either some time before or after their migraine headaches. olfactory hallucinations, involving the smell of cigarette smoke in particular, and their relation to migraines is not a novel

patients imagined the smell of smoke, eight reported a variety of diﬀerent unpleasant smells (3/8 smelled gas), and two reported hallucinating pleasant smells. the duration of their pre-migraine smells ranged from 3 to 5min up to 24h ( 9). another case report from 2020 similarlyreporteda51-year-oldmalewhoexperiencesolfactory hallucinations of the smell of gas up to 60–180min before his migraines ( 10). in comparison, our second patient had a similar reporting of olfactory hallucinations that preceded her migraines for several minutes before. all of these reported patients,includingours,alsohadnohistoryofseizuresorbrain abnormalities, revealing that their olfactory hallucinations are likelyinﬂuencedbythecsdpathophysiologyoftheirmigraine. in contrast, our ﬁrst patient’s olfactory hallucinations consist of alongstandingaurathatlastupto3–7daysafterhermigraines. an olfactory hallucination that occurs for several days after the migraine headache resolves has never been reported in the literature. the reason for this diﬀerence in symptoms is unknownandwarrantsfurtherstudyonhowotherlongstanding migraine auras physiologically persist. olfactory hallucinations have been traditionally associated with the temporal lobe ( 11), and it would be interesting to see if the csd that occur in these types of migraines also has an association with the temporal lobe or rather other cortical areas. finally, while our patients oﬀer insight into the diﬀerent ways olfactory hallucinations can present in patients with migraine disease, more investigation on their formal assessment of olfactory function, diﬀerences in family/social history and future response to therapeutic interventionsneedstobedone. olfactory hallucinations and their relation to migraine aura have been reported since 1895 ( 8), and the number of reports about their association continues to increase. the prevalence of olfactory aura is likely underreported ( 9) because patients and physicians do not know or expect olfactory aura to be a part of migraine prodrome. based on the historical signiﬁcance of this phenomenon, we propose that olfactory hallucinations are considered a subtype of migraine aura in the future. however, larger studies are still required to better assess the pathophysiologyandclassiﬁcationofthisphenomenon.data availability statement the
