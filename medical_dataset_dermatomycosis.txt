(2022) has concluded that of the three genera of dermatomycoses, epidermophyton affects exclusively humans, whereas microsporum and trichophyton, in most cases, affect animals. chowdhary et al. (2022) found that representatives of the genus trichophyton are most often the causative agent of superficial skin diseases of animals and humans, the indan strain of trichophyton indotineae, which is resistant to antifungal drugs, has recently become especially widespread. lysková et al. (2021) also indicated that most cases of a local outbreak of the disease in humans and animals in the czech republic in 2020 were caused by trichophyton quinckeanum, which confirms cross-infection with one pathogen of different species of living organisms. according to paryuni et al. (2020), there is an increase in the incidence of fungal skin diseases in the world. in particular, in europe, the incidence of dermatophytosis in cats and dogs ranges from 20% to 30%, depending on the country. the increase in morbidity is facilitated by the fact that the pathogens of infection are very *corresponding author: mynbay umitzhanov. department of biological safety, kazakh national

attribution-noncommercial 4.0 international license abstract background: there is an increase in the incidence of human and animal infectious skin diseases of fungal etiology in the world. the main source of infecting the population has become agricultural and stray animals. aim: the objective of this study was to examine the morphophysiological and microbiological characteristics of pathogenic fungi belonging to the species trichophyton verrucosum. this species is known to cause diseases in both humans and livestock in kazakhstan. in addition, the study aimed to assess the feasibility of using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method for detecting t. verrucosum. this assessment was conducted in comparison to the outcomes of conventional laboratory diagnostic tests commonly employed for trichophytosis. methods: the research focused on analyzing 141 samples of pathological material obtained from calves in almaty, turkestan, and kyzylorda regions. these calves exhibited clinical symptoms of skin disease. the study aimed to identify the causative agent using various techniques, including microscopic examination, microbiological methods involving the isolation of pure cultures, and pcr. results: the detection of the causative agent of dermatophytosis using conventional methods was relatively low, 86% for the microscopic method, and 79% for the microbiological method with the isolation of the culture of the pathogen. extraction and detection of the genetic material of the causative agent of the disease for pcr was carried out according to the method developed by the authors. the effectiveness of the pcr method was 97.9%, which is significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared with the diagnostic effectiveness of conventional methods. the pcr method using specific primers identified the causative agent in 98% of cases, which significantly (p < 0.05) exceeded the results obtained using conventional diagnostic methods. accordingly, the pcr method had better sensitivity and specificity indicators. conclusion: the conducted study recommends the method of pcr diagnosis of dermatophytosis for fast and reliable confirmation of the diagnosis of dermatophytosis in humans and animals in kazakhstan. keywords: microscopy, fungal cultivation, prognostic predictive value, dermatophytosis, molecular detection. submitted: 30/08/2023 accepted: 15/12/2023 published:

is critical for prompt treatment and preventing spread but can be challenging due to the nonspecific symptoms and limitations of traditional diagnostic methods like microscopy and fungal culture (paliy et al., 2023). misdiagnosis allows infections to persist, leading to exacerbated symptoms, transmission to others, and potentially the emergence of antifungal resistance (bulegenova et al., 2019). this highlights the need for more reliable diagnostic techniques. in recent years, dermatomycosis outbreaks have been increasingly reported in urban areas of kazakhstan, primarily affecting stray cat and dog populations. this poses a significant public health concern, as animals serve as reservoirs for zoonotic transmission to humans, particularly children. beyond the direct health impacts, dermatomycosis outbreaks can have detrimental economic effects stemming from treatment costs and productivity losses (hajiyeva et al., 2022). only in 2022, in kazakhstan, according to the publications of news portals, fungal skin diseases in people were registered quite often. according to forbes.kz, last year, 51 people were affected last year in kostanay region alone (forbes, 2022). similar reports were published last year on the 24.kz (2022) portal, where it was already reported about 76 infected people with dermatophytosis in kyzylorda in the first half of 2022, as well as on the liter.kz (2023) portal, with reference to the ministry of health of the republic of kazakhstan, about a 1.5-fold increase in the incidence of fungal skin diseases among people compared to the previous year in almaty (2023). the greatest incidence of dermatophytosis was recorded among children under 14 years of age, 85% of all cases. the increase in morbidity in kazakhstan can be traced only in an epidemiological way, while little attention is paid to the main source of dermatophytosis—agricultural and domestic animals (kirimbayeva et al., 2023). this aspect of the spread of infection remains beyond statistics. in the region of kazakhstan, the most common etiological agent identified for dermatophytosis is the trichophyton verrucosum (kukhar et al., 2019). individuals affected by this fungal infection often experience a range of clinical symptoms, which kickstart with itching being the most noticeable initial sign, leading to an irresistible urge to scratch the affected area of the skin (suleymanova, 2022). following the itching, inflammation arises, causing the skin to become sore, which might result in discomfort or even pain. the skin may also exhibit redness or develop a rash, making the affected area visibly distinct. small papular vesicles, which are small, raised, fluid-filled bumps, may emerge on the skin, further exacerbating the discomfort. in some instances, the rash may display a central clearing, where the center appears normal or clear surrounded by a ring of red, inflamed skin. the manifestation of these symptoms can vary significantly from one individual to another, and the severity of the infection also plays a crucial role in the presentation of symptoms, thereby making dermatophytosis a condition with a diverse symptomatic profile (nussipov et al., 2017). in agricultural settings, there is an ongoing effort to vaccinate young animals against dermatophytosis as part of antiepizootic measures. however, in large urban areas, the presence of a significant population of stray cats and dogs is contributing to an increase in the occurrence of dermatophytosis among both animals and the human population. consequently, a significant number of reports regarding outbreaks of trichophytic dermatophytosis in kazakhstan are originating from major cities such as almaty and kostanay. the manuscript posits several key hypotheses regarding the diagnostics of dermatomycosis/dermatophytosis. first, it suggests that traditional diagnostic methods, specifically microscopic examination, and microbiological seeding, might fall short in their sensitivity and specificity. moreover, while modern diagnostic techniques, such as maldi -tof and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), have been introduced as alternatives, they too come with limitations and might not completely overcome the challenges associated with older methods. central to the research is the assertion that the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique could potentially emerge as a more accurate, efficient, and rapid tool for diagnosing dermatomycosis/dermatophytosis (tyliszczak et al., 2018). this study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of pcr for diagnosing dermatomycosis caused by t. verrucosum, compared to traditional microscopic examination and fungal culture techniques. while a promising method, limitations exist in that pcr reagents can be expensive and require skilled technicians. furthermore, genetic mutations could impact primer binding, reducing detection sensitivity over time. materials and methods sample collection samples were obtained from a total of 141 pathological materials collected from calves across individual farms in the almaty, turkestan, and kyzylorda regions between 2018 and 2022. these samples were taken from the periphery of skin lesions that had not undergone topical drug treatment. information including the date and place of collection, age of the animal, and the degree of lesion were recorded in parallel. the collected material was placed in test tubes with cotton plugs. sample preparation a portion of the collected material was transferred to a slide using a preparation needle. subsequently, http://www.openveterinaryjournal.com m. umitzhanov et al. open veterinary journal , (2023), v ol. 13(12): 1614–1622 161615%–20% alkaline caustic potassium solution was added, and the mixture was briefly heated until crystals formed around the drop. following this, a drop of 50% glycerine solution was added, and a cover glass was placed over the preparation. the samples were then examined at magnifications of 10× and 40×. microbiological analysis the samples were inoculated on saburo agar (topan llp, uralsk), selective medium m188 (himedia, india), and m1026 with rice extract (himedia, india). to prevent the growth of saprophytic bacteria, penicillin antibiotics were added to the media at a dose of 60–120 μg/cm³. particles of pathological material were transferred to the nutrient medium using a sterile loop and placed at a distance of 1–1.5 cm. up to 10 seedings were performed for each sample. incubation was conducted for 3–4 weeks at a temperature of 25°c–30°c, with periodic inspections. the type of pathogen was determined by assessing the shape, color, and pigmentation of colonies on the nutrient medium, followed by microscopic examination of the mycelium’s shape, spore placement, and other structural features of the vegetative form. dna extraction dna extraction was carried out via nucleosorption. a test tube containing the pathological material was mixed with 300 ml of lysis solution (5m guanidine thiocyanate, 1% triton x100). after mixing, the reaction mixture was heated for 5 minutes at 65°c and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 10,000 × g to isolate dna. the supernatant was transferred to a new test tube, and 25 ml of sorbent (silica gel) was added. after mixing and settling, the sorbent was precipitated by centrifugation, and the precipitate was dissolved in 300 ml of a washing solution (5m guanidine thiocyanate). next, 950 ml of washing solution (70% ethyl alcohol) was added to the precipitate, and it was centrifuged for 30 seconds at 2,000 × g. the supernatant was removed, and the precipitate was dried in a thermostat for 5–10 minutes at 65°c. subsequently, 50 ml of te buffer for dna elution was added to the test tube, mixed, and placed in a thermostat at 65°c for 5 minutes. the tubes were then centrifuged for 1 minute at 10,000 g, resulting in purified dna ready for pcr. pcr pcr was conducted in a tertsik amplifier using a kit with taq dna polymerase and an as buffer from sibenzyme. initially, dna denaturation was performed at 94°c for 2 minutes, followed by 25–30 amplification cycles. each cycle included dna denaturation at 94°c for 20 seconds, primer annealing at a temperature ranging from 58°c to 64°c for 20 seconds, and elongation at 72°c for 10–20 seconds. amplification product analysis was carried out through agarose gel electrophoresis. statistical analysis statistical analysis of the pcr results was performed using tibco statistica version 14.0.0.15. specificity, sensitivity, diagnostic effectiveness, prognostic value, and both positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated to assess the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of the test. significance was determined. results all the collected samples were examined in parallel using two conventional diagnostic methods— microscopic phase-contrast examination and isolation on nutrient media to obtain pure cultures. the results were obtained, which are presented in table 1. from the studies, 98 cases had their preliminary diagnoses validated, accounting for 69.5% of all samples assessed. dermatophytes were detected in 98 samples of skin scrapings from symptomatic calves through conventional laboratory methods. light (phase-contrast) microscopy identified fungal elements in 86 (87.8%) of these cases. mycological studies using culture on nutrient media identified them in 79 (80.6%) instances. it is notable that while microscopy serves as a preliminary diagnostic tool, it was the sole confirmation of skin infection in 19 (19.4%) instances. only 67 (68.4%) of the diagnoses were concurrently confirmed by both regulated methods, which suggests potential issues with the specificity and sensitivity of these procedures. lack of fungal growth in certain samples could be attributed to nonviable fungal spores, possibly a result of prior treatments for nondermatophyte-related conditions. microscopic examination of wool and hair revealed distinctive signs of fungal infections. notably, a sheath of arthrospores was observed encircling the hair bulb. in addition, spore chains were discovered both around and within the hair shaft. accompanying these spores, mycelial strands were identified both externally and internally in the wool, as well as within skin flakes. the diameter of these arthrospores in pathological samples extracted from calves diagnosed with dermatophytosis varied between 2.5 and 7 µm. phase contrast microscopy of samples from smooth skin areas presented pronounced mycelial strands of varying lengths. these filaments predominantly exhibited a linear morphology, occasionally demonstrating branching and segmented patterns. interestingly, atypical mycelial forms were observed in certain samples, particularly those sourced from calves in the turkestan region. these irregularities displayed table 1. results of studies of samples of pathological material obtained from calves in 2018–2022. method of laboratory researchnumber of samplesresults positive negative sample microscopy 141 86 55 mycological studies with culture isolation141 79

indicative of a prolonged, chronic infection. microscopic analysis also highlighted polymorphic spores with an inconsistent morphology, either dispersed freely or arranged in chain formations. while these specimens were recognized as indicative of dermatophytosis, ascertaining the precise pathogenic species from their morphological features posed challenges. all tissue and wool samples underwent mycological examination irrespective of their microscopic analysis results. from these, 79 pure cultures of pathogenic fungi were derived. mycological cultivation exhibited the emergence of slow-growing colonies characterized by a discoid configuration with a prominent leathery, wrinkled center of a greyish-yellow hue and a powdery whitish periphery. to identify the specific pathogen type from the colony culture, preparations were made and subjected to phase-contrast microscopy. this revealed an abundance of branching mycelial strands with accompanying spores. furthermore, chlamydospore development was evident at the filament tips, manifesting in brush-like formations. given the general observation that the pathogenic fungal species cultivated thrived at the body temperatures of the host animals, the cultivation temperature was marginally increased to 37°c. in addition, thiamine was introduced to the cultivation medium. these amendments to the mycological cultivation protocol not only facilitated faster growth of vegetative forms but also yielded colonies with a more consistent morphology. by assessing the microbiological and morphological features, including the structure of the micellar filaments, the arrangement and morphology of the spores, and the various attributes of colony growth, the fungi were classified as t. verrucosum. the extraction and identification of genetic material from animals exhibiting skin disease symptoms were executed following a method tailored for dna extraction from skin samples, specifically designed for the pcr process. the extracted dna content from pathological samples ranged between 2 and 37 ng/µl, adequately meeting the prerequisites for the pcr technique in terms of sample volume. the pcr approach centers on amplifying a specific gene fragment found in rna, which encodes for chitin synthetase. primers from the “sibenzyme” diagnostic kit for dermatomycoses detection were employed. the 30 µl reaction mixture comprised 1 µl of the dna obtained from the pathological material, 3 µl of a 10× taq polymerase buffer, 1 µl of specific primers, and 1 µl of taq polymerase. the “hot start” method was incorporated to optimize pcr and diminish nonspecific amplification. herein, to minimize the chances of primers nonspecifically annealing to low- homologous nucleotide sequences, taq polymerase was introduced post preheating to 94°c. electrophoresis ran at a consistent 120 v voltage. a positive pcr result was signified by the detection of specific amplification products: target fragments of 231 bp that exhibited luminescent red-orange bands post-electrophoresis. for visualization, the agarose gel underwent ethidium bromide staining for a duration of 10–15 minutes. the electrophoresis outcomes were visualized in a uv chamber ( fig. 1). utilizing the pcr technique alongside the sibenzyme test kit—inclusive of taq dna polymerase and an as buffer—facilitated the detection of genetic material in 96 of the 98 confirmed fungal infection cases, accounting for a 98% success rate. this notably surpassed the outcomes of traditional diagnostic assays. a comparative analysis of the discussed diagnostic approaches based on criteria such as predictive value, study duration, and test complexity revealed pcr’s superiority. while microscopic evaluation proved to be the swiftest and most cost-effective, it merely provides an initial diagnosis, necessitating further infectious agent isolation for validation. comparing microbiological cultivation with pcr, the molecular genetic method emerges as distinctly advantageous. conventional mycological examination can span 3–4 weeks for diagnosis confirmation, in contrast to mere hours via pcr. given that dermatomycoses are zoonoses, this time factor is paramount. furthermore, within this study’s scope, pcr’s efficacy in validating the preliminary diagnosis exceeded the standard fungi cultivation technique by 19%. to meticulously gauge the informativeness of the pcr method in detecting t. verrucosum dermatomycetes within pathological material—versus standard laboratory diagnostic procedures for calf fungal skin ailments—several statistical metrics were employed. this involved criteria grounded on the determination of sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic result efficacy, and the likelihood of obtaining a credible outcome. the ensuing statistical insights derived from this study’s sample are illustrated in figure 2. fig. 1. results of electrophoretic separation of pcr amplification products of a sample of pathological material from a sick animal.http://www.openveterinaryjournal.com m. umitzhanov et al. open veterinary journal , (2023), v ol. 13(12): 1614–1622 indicators of specificity and sensitivity, diagnostic effectiveness, prognostic value, and likelihood ratio were calculated. the highest statistical results were observed for the pcr method. thus, the proportion of truly positive cases of diseases in the controlled group of animals determined by pcr was 98% (p < 0.05), which is significantly higher in comparison with conventional diagnostic methods. accordingly, the pcr specificity index significantly exceeded the results obtained by microscopy and cultivation and amounted to 97.7% (p < 0.05). however, a more important indicator in evidence-based medicine is diagnostic effectiveness (derkach and klymenko, 2023). compared with other methods of laboratory diagnosis of dermatophytosis, which were used in the analysis of the material, pcr allowed with much greater accuracy—97.9% (p < 0.05) to determine the frequency of positive and negative cases of the disease in the controlled population. a statistical analysis of the comparative characteristics of diagnostic methods for dermatophytosis would not be complete without calculating predictive indicators that describe the test distribution of morbidity in the study population. the results of this analysis are shown in table 2. the method of determining predictive value indicators consists of comparing the results obtained using the diagnostic method with the most reliable diagnostic method and calculating quantitative coefficients characterizing this comparison. since none of the methods can be considered a reference for dermatophytosis, the comparison was made with the complex result of standard methods that are recommended for laboratory diagnostics of mycological skin diseases. as in the case of previous statistical results, the predictive coefficients turned out to be more reliable for the pcr than for other methods used. thus, the probability of the presence of the disease with a positive pcr result for dermatophytosis caused by the pathogen t. verrucosum, estimated through a positive prognostic value, had the greatest value (98.9), as well as the value of the likelihood ratio of a positive result (32.3), determining the presence of a true disease with the lowest probability of obtaining a negative result (0.03). the results of the studies and their statistical analysis indicate that the pcr method allows the detection and identification of pathogens of dermatophytosis, in particular t. verrucosum, in various samples of pathological material. in addition, this method has significantly higher diagnostic efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity in the laboratory diagnosis of zooanthroponous dermatomycoses, compared with the microscopic and cultural methods. discussion the increase in the incidence of fungal skin diseases in animals and humans has become a reality in the modern world. outbreaks of infection among the population of several prosperous european countries require a revision of the principles of diagnosing such diseases to ensure prompt treatment and timely prevention. an increase in the number of stray animals in cities, where the epidemiological process is most widespread, contributes to the aggravation of the situation, since it is this group of animals that has been identified as the main source of infection. considering the similarity of clinical signs of dermatophytosis with other skin diseases, as well as the increase in the number of cases of registration of atypical and latent forms of development of these diseases in animals, makes the search for modern express methods of diagnosis of mycoses an urgent area of research. the conventional mechanism of diagnosis for mycological skin diseases involves the use of two methods—microscopic examination of pathological material and microbiological, the purpose fig. 2. comparative assessment of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic effectiveness in the diagnosis of dermatophytosis. 1618http://www.openveterinaryjournal.com m. umitzhanov et al. open veterinary journal , (2023), v ol. 13(12): 1614–1622 1619of which is to obtain a pure culture of the pathogen and its identification (akhmetov and chidunchi, 2015; zhantlessova et al., 2022). if the first method allows, almost in a matter of minutes, to identify signs of mycological infection in animals and humans, then the duration of the microbiological method, even with the most optimistic calculations, lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. this indicates that almost every third animal from which pathological material was taken was not a patient with dermatophytosis. such a high percentage of negative results is associated with similar symptoms of dermatophytosis with inflammatory and other skin lesions. given the ability of dermatophytosis pathogens to cause diseases in humans, diagnostics should confirm or refute the preliminary diagnosis with a high degree of reliability in a short period of time. in further studies and statistical calculations, samples were used only after laboratory confirmation of the disease and isolation of the pathogen from the pathological material. considering the results obtained as part of the research for the preparation of this paper, it can be stated that even experienced veterinary specialists who selected pathological material in a third of cases could not distinguish dermatophytosis from other skin diseases, since in 30.5% of samples of pathological material none of the conventional methods of pathogens of fungal etiology were isolated. this is conditioned by the fact that the effectiveness of conventional methods turned out to be low. the sensitivity of the microscopic examination method was 87.8%, and microbiological seeding was even lower—80.6%, which is not enough for zooanthroponotic diseases when there is a possibility of developing the disease among the population. similar conclusions were made by heckler et al. (2023), since late or incorrect diagnosis is dangerous with a potential health risk; therefore, the authors consider the use of modern diagnostic methods for accelerated diagnosis of dermatophytosis. according to gosink (2022), conventional methods are characterized by a high percentage of false positive and false negative diagnoses. the morphological characteristics of the causative agent of cattle dermatophytosis t. verrucosum, and the physiological features of cultures isolated from samples of pathological material with fungal lesions of the skin and coat of calves were studied. despite the presence of characteristic morphological signs of mycelium and spores of the pathogen, based on which their preliminary differentiation is possible, the latter remains a rather difficult task. this is conditioned by adaptive changes in the morphological structure of the pathogen due to the action of pharmacological drugs on it or the protective mechanisms of the body itself in chronic infection. the study by gnat et al. (2019) indicates a change in the morphological structure of the causative agent of the disease with frequent passages, prolonged cultivation on “hungry” media, or other factors. therefore, the authors point out that the phenotype of the pathogen under microscopy cannot be the basis for a diagnosis. in studies, when comparing microscopic and mycological methods, their effectiveness differed significantly. thus, in the diagnosis of dermatophytosis caused by t. verrucosum, the informative value of the cultural method was characterized by the following indicators: sensitivity—80.6%, specificity—79.1%, and diagnostic efficiency—80.1%, which turned out to be significantly lower than the corresponding values obtained by microscopic examination of 87.8%, 88.4%, and 87.9%. a possible explanation for this pattern is the complexity of cultivating t. verrucosum, which is consistent with the study by peano et al. (2008). until recently, it was not possible to solve the problem of a fast and highly sensitive method of diagnosing pathogens of dermatophytosis. the applied laboratory methods and techniques, due to their low information content, did not allow them to be recommended as a replacement for the conventional system of diagnosis for fungal skin diseases. the search for modern methods for the diagnosis of dermatophytosis was conducted in different directions—this is the use of the most modern approaches using laser mass spectrometry (maldi- tof) technology and the easiest to carry out elisa. however, each of these methods has its drawbacks. maldi-tof, in studies by baumbach et al. (2021), did not reveal the correct identification of the causative agents of dermatophytosis according to the databases provided by the software. more optimistic results were obtained by aruna and ramalingappa (2022), when using the enzyme-linked immunoassay. diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the method were 93.8% and 93.3%, positive and negative prognostic values table 2. predictive performance indicators of the use of different methods in the diagnosis of dermatophytosis caused by t. verrucosum. research methodpredictive value (%) likelihood ratio positive prognostic predictive significancenegative prognostic predictive significancelikelihood ratio of a positive resultlikelihood ratio of a negative result microscopy of pathological material94.5 76 7.3 0.2 cultivation method 89.8 64.2 3.8 0.3 pcr 98.9 95.5 32.3 0.03http://www.openveterinaryjournal.com m. umitzhanov et al. open veterinary journal , (2023), v ol. 13(12): 1614–1622 1620were also high and amounted to 93.8% and 90%, respectively, but a significant antigenic pool of pathogens and cross-reactions between different types of trichophyton makes this method less informative. pcr may be the only promising method that can be used as a reference for the diagnosis of dermatophytosis in animals and humans. a comparative analysis of the results of laboratory methods used in this study showed that pcr was characterized by the highest diagnostic efficiency of 97.9% (p < 0.05) when diagnosing dermatophytosis in young cattle caused by the pathogen of the species t. verrucosum, while standard methods did not exceed 80%–88% efficiency. this is also confirmed by the high values of the sensitivity of the method (80%), its specificity (97.7%), and the prognostic value of a positive result (98.9%), which is with high statistical reliability (p < 0.05) higher than similar indicators obtained during conventional (regulated) research methods. similar conclusions were obtained by gräser and saunte (2020), which indicate that molecular diagnostics are 30% more sensitive than microbiological methods. one of the main predictive indicators that allow classifying pcr as the most accurate diagnostic method is the likelihood ratio of a positive result (iskakova et al., 2022). statistical calculations of quantitative indicators obtained during the research in the framework of this study indicate that the probability of an accurate diagnosis in pcr is several times higher than when using conventional approaches in the diagnosis of skin mycoses. moreover, the likelihood of obtaining a negative result with pcr (0.03) was revealed to be an order of magnitude lower than that of microscopic and mycological methods, 0.2 and 0.3, respectively. the results obtained are also confirmed in the study by álvarez-mosquera et al. (2018), in which high prognostic values were obtained for both positive and negative diagnoses (90.9% and 94.6%, respectively). summing up the results of the study and preparing recommendations for subsequent work on the development of objective ideas about the extent of the spread of dermatophytosis, the authors suggest that the most appropriate method for monitoring morbidity among the cattle population is the use of molecular genetic approaches that are able to identify and establish the typification of the pathogen with a high degree of probability. therefore, future studies will be aimed at conducting a clinical test of the pcr method for its implementation and regulation in laboratory practice for the detection and confirmation of the diagnosis of dermatophytosis caused by the causative agent t. verrucosum in kazakhstan, since the research results indicate that this method is significantly more informative when searching for fungal infection in pathological material compared with microscopic and cultural methods. summarising the results of the experiments and analyzing the results obtained, the authors recommend using the pcr method for widespread use in the laboratory diagnosis of dermatophytosis. this method is able to confirm or refute the diagnosis in a short period of time, which will allow us to move to a new level of the fight against dermatophytosis. using the pcr method in both epidemiological and veterinary diagnostics will reduce the time it takes to confirm the disease and enable the implementation of preventive measures to prevent the spread of infection. conclusion in the comprehensive study on the diagnostic methods for dermatophytosis, findings underscore the limitations of conventional methods. microscopic examination and microbiological cultivation, while historically significant, yielded a diagnostic effectiveness of no more than 88%. conversely, the pcr method demonstrated superior diagnostic capabilities, with an efficacy rate of 97.9%. this method’s adaptability in extracting genetic material from skin and wool samples, combined with the precision of the primers used, ensures reliable detection of the t. verrucosum pathogen. however, the study has its limitations. the focused sample set, specifically from calves, might limit the generalization of findings across diverse animal populations or different fungal pathogens. moreover, while pcr showed promising results, its practical application in varied settings, considering potential logistical or technical challenges, remains unexplored. future research should delve into the clinical applicability of the pcr method across different animal species and geographies. comparative studies with other emerging diagnostic technologies could further elucidate the most effective strategies. understanding barriers to the widespread adoption of pcr, both technologically and regulatorily, especially in regions such as kazakhstan, becomes paramount. this study acts as a foundation, emphasizing the transition from traditional to advanced molecular diagnostic methods, with the ultimate goal of timely and accurate detection of dermatophytosis to mitigate its spread and enhance animal health outcomes. acknowledgments none. author contributions a and b developed the project. c performed the experiment. d and e

cats; rabbits; wounds; dexpanthenol; morpho-physiological parameters of blood; blood serum introduction every year, the number of small pets in the private homes of urban citizens is constantly growing. the most common pathology among animal diseases is mechan-ical damage to the skin – wounds that require urgent care. veterinarians are provided with a large number of treatment tools, but the search and development of en-vironmentally friendly and safe veterinary drugs for the treatment of skin pathologies in small pets remain an urgent issue. all wounds, without exception, heal through inflam- mation, and in the absence of antiseptic treatment – through suppuration. many aspects of wound healing in small animals have not yet been fully clarified: mech-anisms of inhibition of granulation tissue growth and maturation, differentiation of connective tissue cells, and the relationship between inflammation, regener-ation, and fibrosis in complicated wounds (mauldin & peters-kennedy, 2016; fernandes et al., 2018; somjorn et al., 2021). conservative means and methods of treat - ing complicated wounds are often ineffective. there is a need to further search for new and improve registered drugs and treatment methods that stimulate reparative processes in wounds of various etiologies, and an in-depth investigation of their pharmacognosy. darwin & tomic-canic (2018) proved that the wound process is a dynamic self-regulating system, as each of its phases prepares and starts the next. the suc - cess of the wound process (davidson, 2015; gonzalez et al., 2016; cañedo-dorantes & cañedo-ayala, 2019) depends on the type, size, location of the wound, gran-ulation features, nature and amount of wound exudate, invasiveness and virulence of microorganisms, the immune status of the patient’s body, the presence of concomitant diseases, and the rational choice of wound treatment tactics. the main condition for the normal course of the wound healing process is the synchro-nisation of the epithelialisation process, on the one hand, and the maturation of granulation tissue, on the other. thus, in the dynamics of wound healing, three main periods are noted: cleaning of the wound defect from necrotic masses due to inflammation; prolifera-tion of connective tissue elements with the formation of granulation tissue filling the wound; scar formation, its remodelling, and epithelialisation of tissues (stettler et al., 2017; lux, 2022). basov et al. ( 2021) developed and tested the use in surgical practice of a device for visual monitoring of the wound during its treatment with pharmacological solutions (including antiseptic, antiseptic oxidizer, and osmotically active agent). this method accelerates the therapeutic effect by 43.8% compared to wound treat - ment with a 0.02% aqueous chlorhexidine solution and a local ointment with an antibiotic. negative pressure wound therapy (npwt) has been used in europe and the united states for about 15 years. studies by nolff (2021) on cats have shown that the de - vice effectively copes with infected wounds, increases gran - ulation and neovascularisation, and promotes wound narrowing through active macrocontrtaction. the group of researchers (bekeschus et al., 2021) tested gas plasma technology and recommended it for use in veterinary practice. reactive oxygen and nitrogen forms have been shown to promote wound healing at various stages, have a negative effect on various types of microorganisms that complicate the inflammatory process, and lead to rapid hemostasis in the wounds of experimental animals (rodents and pigs). enciso et al. (2020) recommend the use of allogeneic asc therapy to improve the healing of acute and chronic wounds in dogs. they proved that treatment of wounds with fat mesenchymal stem cells from an adult animal already on the 90th day contributes to re-epithelialisation (more than 97%). alshehabat et al. (2020), based on experimental studies, suggest using the following methods for treating wounds in dogs: wet burn ointment (contains b-sitos- terol, baicalin, and berberine as active ingredients based on beeswax and sesame oil). they note that this method paliy et al. scientific horizons, 2023, vol. 26, no. 31111 of treatment helps to accelerate epithelialisation, quickly reduces the wound area, and does not cause allergic re - actions in animals with weakened immune systems. in recent years, the attention of researchers has been attracted to therapeutic drugs for wound heal - ing, especially with signs of bacterial infection, based on pantothenic acid. researchers (ebner et al., 2002; li-mei et al., 2016; ogden et al., 2019 ) prove that it is necessary for the normal function of the epithelium. it is a component of coenzyme a, which serves as a co-factor for various enzyme-catalysed reactions that are important in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fatty acids, proteins, gluconeogenesis, sterols, steroid hor - mones, and porphyrins. a stable alcoholic analogue of pantothenic acid is dexpanthenol, the local application of which is based on good penetration into the skin and rapid local concentration. during the treatment of su - perficial, postoperative wounds, and scars at the stage of formation, its effectiveness increases if dexpanthe - nol is introduced into the emulsion or ointments. it pro - vides support for anti-inflammatory and antioxidant ac - tivity, which play an important role in cellular defence and recovery systems against oxidative stress and in - flammatory response (marquardt et al., 2015; nahirniy, 2022). proksch et al. (2017) identified that the mode of action of dexpanthenol at the molecular level increases the mobility of molecular components of the stratum corneum of the skin, which are important for ensuring its barrier function, and modulates the expression of genes important for wound healing . the purpose of this study was to determine the therapeutic effectiveness of dexpanthenol-based oint - ment in wound processes in small domestic animals. materials and methods the study was conducted in 2020-2021 based on the laboratory of veterinary hygiene and parasitology of the national scientific centre “institute of experimen - tal and clinical veterinary medicine”, and in an ani - mal shelter (balakliya, kharkiv region). the study pro - gramme was reviewed and approved in accordance with the current procedure by the bioethics commis - sion of the national scientific centre “institute of ex - perimental and clinical veterinary medicine”. a drug with the active substance dexpanthenol was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the ointment in the treatment of wounds in domestic animals. compo - sition of the product (1 ml): dexpanthenol – 10 mg; ex - cipients: decamethoxine, vaseline oil, emulsifier, glycer - in, methylparaben, propylparaben, purified water. the following groups of animals were formed to conduct research: group i (intact animals) – clinically healthy animals. no clinical signs of skin damage were identified. the skin was smooth, elastic, moderately hydrated. group ii (control pathology) – animals with skin damage, whose owners sought help within the first five days after the occurrence of wound damage. by origin, wounds are accidental, by the nature of the damage – stab and torn, by the depth of the damage – surface, by the degree of tissue destruction – with a large area of damage, by the degree of infection – contaminated. the animals were not treated with chemotherapeutic agents. group iii (experiment) – animals with skin damage, whose owners sought help within the first four hours af - ter the occurrence of wound damage (fresh wounds). by origin, wounds are accidental, by the nature of the dam - age – stab and torn, by the depth of the damage – surface, by the degree of tissue destruction – with a large area of damage, by the degree of infection – contaminated. the animals were treated with the drug under study. in the first stage of the study, the wound-healing effectiveness of a veterinary drug was examined on mongrel cats of different ages and sexes. the following groups of animals were formed to conduct research: group i (intact control) – clinically healthy mongrel cats (n=15) aged 1 to 4 years with body weight from 2.1 to 3.9 kg. the animals were kept in a vivarium, but they did not have skin pathology, and the drug was not applied to them. group ii (positive control, control pathology) – ani - mals (n=9) with skin damage without treatment. group iii (experiment) – animals (n=15) that were treated with the drug under study on damaged skin areas. the animals were kept in aviaries on a standard balanced diet with free access to water, according to physiological needs. during the experiment, cats were examined, which included visual, palpation, thermom - etry, respiratory and heart rate examinations. clinical examination of cats in the study groups included a de - tailed medical history and examination of the condi - tion of the skin and mucous membranes (stein, 1981; vojtkovská et al., 2020). dynamic monitoring of animals was performed and changes in the wound surface area were determined 3, 7, and 14 days after the onset of the pathological process. in cats of the experimental groups, the affected skin areas were treated with preparations by applying a thin layer to the skin 3 times a day. before applying the drug, hygienic treatment of the affected area was performed. evaluation of the wound-healing effect of the drug was performed by analysing the ac - tivity of wound surface contraction in dynamics on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 14th days, determining the area of the wound surface in animals. the intensity of skin damage was established: slight erythema, clear erythema, clear erythema with compaction, erythema with hem - orrhagic phenomena, and ulcers with severe infiltration (elzayat et al. , 2018; sofrona et al., 2020). during the study period, blood samples were taken from cats for haematological and biochemical evaluation: before the drug was used, on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 14th days of the experiment. in the second stage of experimental studies, the effectiveness of the veterinary drug was examined on treatment of pets with the active substance dexpanthenol in wound processes scientific horizons, 2023, vol. 26, no. 312 mongrel dogs of different ages and sexes. the follow - ing groups of animals were formed to conduct research: group i (intact animals) – clinically healthy mon - grel dogs (n=17) aged from 1 to 9 years with body weight from 3.8 to 9.7 kg. no clinical signs of skin dam - age were identified. group ii (control pathology) – dogs (n=10) with skin damage without correction and treatment. group iii (experiment) – dogs (n=17) that were treated with the drug under study on damaged skin areas. animals of the control and experimental groups were kept in aviaries on a standard balanced diet with free access to water, according to physiological needs. clinical examination of dogs of the experimental groups included a detailed medical history and evalu - ation of the coat condition, namely, the determination of thickness, elasticity, and dryness of the skin (hardy, 1981). dynamic monitoring of dogs was performed and changes in the wound surface area were determined 3, 5, 7, 9, and 14 days after the onset of the pathological pro - cess. in dogs of experimental groups, the affected skin areas were treated with the drug by applying a thin layer 3 times a day. before applying the drug, hygienic treat - ment of the affected area was performed (frees, 2018). when assessing the influence of the adverse factor, substantial deviations in relation to the indicators of animals of the intact group and control pathology were determined (р ˂0.05). the criteria for the wound-healing effect of the drug under study were only substantially positive changes in the examined indicators in relation to the control pathology group. during the study period, blood samples were taken from dogs for haematological and biochemical studies: before the drug was administered, on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th days of the experiment. in the third stage of the experiment, the wound-heal - ing effectiveness of the drug under study was examined on decorative rabbits. the following groups of animals were formed to conduct research: group i (intact animals) – clinically healthy decora - tive rabbits (n=5) without skin damage. group ii (control pathology) – rabbits (n=5) with skin damage without correction and treatment. group iii (experiment) – rabbits (n=5), that were treated with the drug under study on damaged skin areas. animals of the control and experimental groups were kept in cages on a standard diet with free access to water, according to physiological needs. clinical ex - amination of rabbits of the research groups included determining the condition of the coat. in rabbits of the experimental groups, the affected skin areas were treated with the drug by applying a thin layer 3 times a day. before applying the drug, hygienic treatment of the affected area was performed. assessment of the wound-healing effect of the drug under study was conducted by determining the area of the wound surface in animals in dynamics on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 14th days. when assessing the influence of the adverse factor, substantial deviations in relation to the indicators of animals of the intact group and control pathology were determined (р ˂0.05). the blood samples were kept in test tubes in a ther - mostat for 15 minutes to obtain serum from animals. a stainless metal stick was applied along the inner wall of the test tube to separate the serum from the clot. the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min - utes. blood serum was taken using a pipette dispenser in sterile eppendorf-type tubes. haematological examinations included: the de - termination of total haemoglobin (hgb), hematocrit (hct), red blood cell count (rbc), and white blood cell count (wbc) (bauer & moritz, 2008; becker et al., 2008). the level of activity of the following enzymes was determined in the blood serum of animals: ala - nine aminotransferase (alat; ec 2.6.1.2) and aspartate aminotransferases (asat; ec 2.6.1.1) according to the reitman-frenkel method (wilkinson et al., 1972). examinations of the functional state of the liver of experimental animals included the determination of total protein by turbodimetric method, c-reactive protein (crp), and urea – by the diacetylmonooxime method (doumas et al., 1981). statistical processing of the results was conducted using statistical methods (statistica 10.0 for win - dows) with the determination of the arithmetic mean (m), the statistical error of the arithmetic mean (m), the probability of difference (p) between the arithmetic mean of two variational series by the confidence coef - ficient for the difference of the averages (t). the differ - ence between the two values was considered substan - tial at *р≤0.05;

on day 3 – by 10.03% and 9.04%, respectively; on day 7 – by 9.49% and 8.25%, respectively. on the 14th day of the experiment, no sub - stantial deviations were established. a substantial (p<0.05) increase in the concentration of crp in the blood of rabbits of groups ii and iii was established: before the start of the experiment – by 31.75% and 41.27%, respectively; on the 3rd day of the experiment – by 28.32% and 21.30%, respectively. the activity of the alar and asat enzymes in the blood of rabbits of the experimental group did not substantially differ from the control. the urea content in the blood serum of rabbits of groups ii and iii was substantially (p<0.05) higher than the control: before the experi - ment – by 45.34% and 53.69%; on day 3 – by 48.16% and 42.33%, respectively. on days 7 and 14, deviations of this indicator were within the physiological norm. as a result of the research on the effectiveness of the veterinary drug with the active substance dexpan - thenol, an optimal pharmacological effect was achieved by the authors, namely, a pronounced anti-inflamma - tory and wound-healing effect of the drug: it promotes healing, activation of reparative processes (granulation and epithelialisation) of the skin and mucous mem - branes, and prevents bacterial complications. the drug effectively reduced the area of the wound surface at all stages of the study. saliy et al. (2022), based on a marketing analysis of the pharmaceutical market of ukraine of medicines un - der pressure for veterinary practice, identified that the largest segment belongs to the d03 group “products for the treatment of wounds and ulcerative lesions” – 13.79%, including 12.07% of dexpanthenol-based drugs. researchers (motatabzadeh & abtahi froushani, 2020; barrionuevo-gonzalez et al., 2021; karahan et al., 2021) agreed that dexpanthenol-based preparations, used to achieve an effective therapeutic effect on skin pathol - ogies, in particular, wounds, deserve special attention. be - ing absorbed into the cells of the stratum corneum of the skin, dexpanthenol is rapidly converted to pantothenic acid, thereby contributing to the restoration and regen - eration of damaged skin layers. its effect is enhanced in combination with decamethoxin, which has a bacteri - cidal effect. rodin (2019), based on clinical studies, proved a high therapeutic effect of decamethoxin for skin wounds with bacterial complications. bororova (2021) notes its antimicrobial effect against gram-positive ( staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci ) and gram-negative (menin - gococci, gonococci) cocci, corynebacteria, enterobacteria, pseudomonas , protozoa, dermatophytes, yeast-like fungi of the candida genus, chlamydia, and viruses. the obtained data correlate with the data of other researchers. boehm et al. (2021) prove that a local approach (the use of ointment) is the best treatment option for focal surface bacterial infections to prevent the development of acquired resistance to microbial strains. ogden et al. (2021) proved the therapeutic ef - fect of dexpanthenol on sciatic nerve compression in - jury in an experiment on wistar albino rats. they noted that administration of 50 mg/kg dexpanthenol intra - peritoneally in combination with 10 mg/kg thymoqui - none intraperitoneally once a day for a week. data obtained by sezgin et al. (2019) confirms the hypothesis that the use of dexpanthenol contributes to table 9, continuedtreatment of pets with the active substance dexpanthenol in wound processes scientific horizons, 2023, vol. 26, no. 320 the reduction of wound surface during treatment. in ex - periments on rats, the researchers proved that the local use containing a combination of dexpanthenol, silbiol, undecylenic acid, and lidocaine decreased the wound surface area on the 7th day of treatment from 5.07 to 1.42 mm2 in the test group. as in this experiment, the full therapeutic effect was observed on the 14th day of treatment. the data obtained is also consistent with the results of the group of researchers ( küba et al., 2021). during an experimental assessment of dexpan - thenol (5% ointment) efficacy on rats, the greatest re - duction in wound size in the late postoperative phase was noted: from day 10 to day 14. ulger et al. (2014), comparing the effectiveness of 5% dexpanthenol oint - ment and 5% nebivolol ointment for wound healing, based on experimental modelling of the wound process in rats, concluded that no substantial changes in the healing process were recorded between the examined ointments. however, a therapeutic effect was observed only on the 21st day, which is 6 days longer compared to this experiment. this may be due to a 2-fold lower concentration of the active substance compared to the experimental sample of the ointment in this study. therewith, g ültekin et al. (2020) do not recognise the therapeutic effect of dexpanthenol. during the experi - ment on a monkey, they did not observe any changes in wound size and epithelialisation when using a 4-com - ponent ointment made from a mixture of dexpanthe - nol (5% ointment), nitrofurazone ointment (0.2%), zinc oxide (20%), and сentella asiatica (1%) twice a day for local treatment. however, unlike this experiment, the authors additionally used intramuscular administration of 5% diluted dexpanthenol (500 mg/2 ml ampoule) 1 time for 10 days. the lack of therapeutic effect may be due to the antagonistic effect of the simultaneous use of dexpanthenol and zinc oxide. ultimately, the latter in the experimental 20% concentration shows an astrin - gent effect, due to which the rate and level of dexpan - thenol adsorption are disrupted. conclusions skin inflammations in small pets of various origins are characterised by intense itching of the skin and are complicated by bacterial microflora. in the absence of treatment with a wound-healing ointment, the wound-healing process slows down. changes in morpho-physiological parameters of blood (reduced haemoglobin content, increased hema - tocrit value, urea content, leukocytosis) in experimental animals with signs of a wound process before the start of the experiment indicate the development of endog - enous intoxication syndrome. analysing biochemical parameters in the blood serum of animals with skin damage, a substantial increase in the concentration of total and c-reactive protein was noted. in experimental animals with skin damage, when using a dexpanthenol-based ointment (10 mg per 1 ml), no signs of infection of wounds with microflora and ex - udation were observed. the drug under study effectively reduced the wound surface area in experimental animals during the course of treatment: in cats – by 95.83%, in dogs – by 92.86%, and in decorative rabbits – by 90.63%. on the 14th day of treatment, the number of white blood cells and c-reactive protein in experimen - tal animals were within the physiological norm – in cats – (9.67±0.54) x 109/dm3 4.94±0.24 mg/l, in dogs – (10.77±0.86) x 109/dm3 and 4.75±0.26 mg/l, in rabbits – (8.22±0.90) x 109/dm3 and 4.16±1.20 mg/l, respectively. there is no substantial difference between experimen - tal and intact animals. it was identified that the examined drug is well tol - erated by sick animals, does not cause adverse reactions, does not have a negative effect on healthy tissues, and has a positive effect on the dynamics of haematological and biochemical parameters of the blood of experimen - tal animals. the experimental drug can be recommended for use in clinical veterinary practice as an anti-inflam - matory and wound-healing agent for small pets. acknowledgements the authors express their sincere gratitude to the staff of the laboratory of veterinary hygiene and parasitol - ogy of the national scientific centre “institute of exper - imental and clinical veterinary medicine”, the multi - disciplinary laboratory of the odesa state agrarian university for their assistance in conducting laboratory studies, and the head and veterinarians of the animal shelter (balakliya, kharkiv region) for organising and helping to conduct the experiment. conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest. references [1] alshehabat, m., hananeh, w., ismail, z.b., rmilah, s.a., & abeeleh, m.a.

birds, university of veterinary medicine hannover, foundation, hannover, germany,3laboratory for medical microbiology, mölbis, germany dermatophytoses represent a major health burden in animals and man. zoophilic dermatophytes usually show a high speci ﬁcity to their original animal host but a zoonotic transmission is increasingly recorded. in humans, these infections elicit highly inﬂammatory skin lesions requiring prolonged therapy even in the immunocompetent patient. the correct identi ﬁcation of the causative agent is often crucial to initiate a targeted and effective therapy. to that end, matrix assisted laser desorption ionizationtime-of- ﬂight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) represents a promising tool. the objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability of species identi ﬁcation of zoophilic dermatophytes using maldi-tof ms. the investigation of isolates from veterinary clinicals a m p l e ss u s p i c i o u so fd e r m a t o p h y t o s es suggests a good maldi-tof ms based identi ﬁcation of the most common zoophilic dermatophyte microsporum canis. trichophyton (t.) spp. usually achieved scores only around the cutoff value for secure species identi ﬁcation because of a small number of reference spectra. moreover, these results need to be interpreted with caution due to the close taxonomic relationship ofdermatophytes being re ﬂected in very similar spectra. in our study, the analysis of 50 clinical samples of hedgehogs revealed no correct identi ﬁcation using the provided databases, nor for zoophilic neither fo r geophilic causative agents. after dna sequencing, adaptation of sample processing and an individual extension of the in-house database, acceptable identi ﬁcation scores were achieved ( t. erinacei and arthroderma spp., respectively). a score-oriented distance dendrogram revealed clustering of geophilic isolates of four different species of the genus arthroderma and underlined the close relationship of the important zoophilic agents t. erinacei, t. verrucosum and t. benhamiae by forming a subclade within a larger cluster including different dermatophytes. taken together, maldi-tof ms proofed suitable for theidenti ﬁcation of zoophilic dermatophytes provided fresh cultures are used and the reference library was previously extended with spectra of laboratory-relevant species. frontiers in cellular and

recommended to substantiate the ﬁndings from morphologic and maldi-tof ms analyses, especially for uncommon causative agents. keywords: dermatophytoses, zoonoses, hedgehog, zoophilic, geophilic, trichophyton ,microsporum , trichophyton erinacei introduction dermatophytoses are common worldwide and represent a growing health concern for h uman patients, companion animals and livestock alike ( chermette et al., 2008 ;havlickova et al., 2008 ). these super ﬁcial infections of skin and its appendages (hair, nail, fur, spines, hoofs, claws etc.) are oftencaused by dermatophytes, which are able to invade theaforementioned host structures and digest the tough, ﬁbrous proteins forming their structural framework. they belong tothree main genera, i.e. epidermophyton (e.) ,microsporum (m.) and trichophyton (t.) , and are categorized as anthropophilic, zoophilic and geophilic according to their preferential habitatand evolutionary adaptation t o humans, animals and soil, respectively ( weitzman and summerbell, 1995 ). about 40 species are of clinical relevance in human and veterinarymedicine nowadays ( ferguson and fuller, 2017 ). zoophilic dermatophytes are animal pathogens that often exhibit a strong host speci ﬁcity but also a notable zoonotic potential. human infections with zoophiles (and also geophiles)are highly in ﬂammatory, contagious and the patients frequently need systemic and long-lasting treatments ( weitzman and summerbell, 1995 ;havlickova et al., 2008 ). especially children and adolescents are affected due to close contact to household pets, e.g. cats and guinea pigs, that are often asymptomatic carriers (chermette et al., 2008 ;nenoff et al., 2014a ). routine diagnostic identi ﬁcation of dermatophytosis-causing agents continues to be mostly accomplished by macroscopic andmicroscopic examination of mycological cultures, i.e. mycelia,fruiting bodies and characteristic conidia. this approach is time- consuming and requires expert knowledge due to remarkable morphological similarities between the different species ( nenoff et al., 2013 ). on the other hand, dna sequencing, which is considered the “gold standard ”for species identi ﬁcation, is laborious and resource-expensive ( nenoff et al., 2013 ;heireman et al., 2020 ). moreover, nucleic acid sequence comparison relies on public, not necessarily validated databases that also need to be interpreted cautiously because of non-standardized preparation methods and the ongoing renaming and reclassi ﬁcation of dermatophytes ( abarca et al., 2017 ). on the contrary, the identi ﬁcation of microorganisms based on matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of- ﬂight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms), particularly of bacteria and yeasts, is considered simple, fast and reliable. however, for clinically relevant ﬁlamentous fungi, and especially dermatophytes, the thus-far established sample preparationmethods need extensive adaptati ons since growth requirements and sample processing are more elaborate in these species(v a nv e e ne ta l . ,2 0 1 0 ;carbonnelle et al., 2011 ;juiz et al., 2012 ; biswas and rolain, 2013 ;l’ollivier and ranque, 2017 ). here, we examined the reliability of maldi-tof ms for the identi ﬁcation of closely related zoophilic dermatophytes. furthermore, we compared the spectra obtained from growthin two different conditions, i.e. liquid broth vs. solid agar media.finally, we describe a cohort of samples from our veterinaryclinical practice where the extension of the reference databasewas crucial to identify the uncommon causative agents involved. material and methods sampling and fungal culture clinical specimens of suspected dermatophytoses were routinely sampled according to a modi ﬁed mckenzie brush technique (mackenzie, 1963 ). after a rough disinfection, the margins of lesions were brushed with sterile tooth brushes and hair/spinesand skin scales were transferred to sabouraud-dextrose (2%; sda; siﬁn diagnostics gmbh, berlin, germany) or modi ﬁed dermatophyte agar plates (mda; si ﬁn; containing 0.4 mg/ml cycloheximide). sda and mda were supplemented with0.05 mg/ml gentamicin-sulfate, 0.05 mg/ml chlortetracycline and0.1 mg/ml chloramphenicol). the plates were incubated for one totwo weeks at 28°c (in suspicion of t. verrucosum : 37°c); selected isolates are shown in figure 1 . species identity of pure subcultures was assessed by macroscopic and microscopic examination, sequencing and/or maldi-tof ms measurements (see below). the herein described dermatophyte isolates of wild hedgehogs ( erinaceus europaeus) were obtained after submission of the animals to the clinic showing a poor generalhealth condition or injuries from accidents (asymptomatic and symptomatic for dermatophytoses; sampled in 2018 by the clinic for small mammals, reptiles and birds, university of veterinarymedicine hannover, hannover, germany). sampling ensuedfrom recently deceased or –if medically indicated- euthanized animals as described above ( approval by an animal ethics committee not needed). species identi ﬁcation by dna sequencing and creation of an its-based dendrogram sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (its) of the rdna with a subsequent similarity search using the basic localalignment search tool (blastn; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ blast) was conducted to con ﬁrm species identity. therefore, total dna from pure fungal cultures was extracted using the qiamp ®dna mini kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) according to the manufacturer ’s

(goettingen, germany). the obtained sequences were edited using the chromas 2.6.6 software (technelysium, south brisbane, australia); alignmentand phylogenetic analyses were conducted in mega x ( kumar et al., 2018 ) using the maximum likelihood method and the tamura-nei model ( tamura and nei, 1993 ). the percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is indicatednext to

nucleotide sequences with a total of 1208 positions in the ﬁnal dataset including the dermatophytes isolated during this study andduring veterinary diagnostics, human-derived isolates from theclinical routine of the laboratory of medical microbiology (withinformed patient consent) and sequences derived from thencbi database.all fungal isolates obtained during this study are available at the german collection of microorganisms and cell culturesgmbh (dsmz, braunschweig, germany; see table 1 for the detailed assignment of isolates to culture collection identi ﬁers). the corresponding its sequences of the t. erinacei -isolates were deposited in the ncbi blastn database (see table 1 for acc. no.), for arthroderma spp., these are in preparation. maldi-tof ms measurements maldi-tof ms analyses were carried out using a maldi biotyper™mbt™smart instrument (bruker daltonik gmbh, bremen, germany) and the internal libraries “bdal ”(8468 msps, 2969 species; 12/09/2019) and “filamentous fungi ”(577 msps, 180 species; 12/09/2019). samples for ms measurementswere prepared according to the standard operating procedure(sop) of the manufacturer following a modi ﬁed extended direct transfer or the extraction sample preparation method (sop1867813 “cultivation and sample preparation for filamentous fungi ”; bruker daltonik gmbh) and deposited on a polished steel target (msp 96, cat. no. 8280800, bruker daltonik gmbh).the minor modi ﬁcation consisted of a 2min incubation of fungal material in 70% formic acid in a 1.5ml reaction tube and vigorouspipetting before transferring 1µl of the supernatant to the target(rather than the successive application of “front mycelium ”and formic acid to the same target spot). the target was subsequently loaded into the ms instrument and measurements were carried out in linear positive-ion mode within a mass range of 2-20kdausing the mbt_autox_filfungi settings in the flexcontrolsoftware (version 3.4.204.10 , bruker daltonik gmbh).

trichophyton andmicrosporum . the latter form individual subclades in this lower clade; the very closely related species t. benhamiae andt. erinacei as well as t. mentagrophytes andt. quinckeanum are separated in distinct subclades.baumbach et al. zoophilic dermatophytes identi ﬁed by maldi-tof ms frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology | www.frontiersin.org april 2021 | volume 11 |

that for “liquid cultivation ”, an incubation no longer than 1-2d in the respective culture broth is strongly recommended by themanufacturer; however, on solid media, dermatophyte growth is considerably slower and more time is usually needed to obtain sufﬁcient fungal material from direct specimens for species identi ﬁcation. samples from both growth conditions (solid vs. liquid) were prepared for ms measurements following the extraction samplepreparation procedure described in the above-mentioned sop, i.e. washing fungal material in hplc-grade water and ethanol and a subsequent formic acid/acetonitrile treatment. after thelast centrifugation step, each of at least 12 spots of an mbtbiotarget 96 (cat. no. 1840375; bruker daltonik gmbh) wascovered with 1µl of this solution. the spots were air dried andﬁnally overlaid with 1µl of saturated a-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid solution (hcca matrix; bruker daltonik gmbh) for co-crystallization. the bacterial test standard (bts,cat. no. 8255343; bruker daltonik gmbh) provided by themanufacturer was added to the biotarget 96 as the calibrationstandard and positive control. ms measurements were carried out using the mbt_autox_ filfungi settings in the flexcontrol software (see above). each spot was measured twice to obtain at least 24 raw spectra of each sample; selected raw spectra from different isolates and growthconditions are shown in figure 4 . the subsequent quality control of these raw spectra for msp creation was performed using the flexanalysis software (version3.4.79.0; bruker daltonik gmbh) and included baseline correction, smoothing and peak ﬁltering. msps were created by combining the remaining raw spectra that ful ﬁlled the quality requirements using the “msp creation ”function of the mbt compass explorer softwar e( b r u k e rd a l t o n i kg m b h ) . afterwards, they were scored by the “start identi ﬁcation ” function (mbt compass explorer; bruker daltonik gmbh)through comparison to the above-mentioned libraries and own library-entries after msp creation. a score-oriented distance dendrogram based on the mass spectrometric data of msps (intensity [arbitrary units]/mass-to-charge-ratio) was generated to identify similarities and clusters of the fungi isolated during this study and during routine humanand veterinary diagnostics (distance measure correlation mode,mbt compass explorer, bruker daltonik gmbh; figure 5 ). results its-based identi ﬁcation and phylogenetic analysis of dermatophytes from the cohort of 50 hedge hog-samples of suspected dermatophytoses, 17 samples (34%) gave rise to fungal colonieson sda or mda and were subjected to species identi ﬁcation by maldi-tof ms and its sequencing. none of these cultures were identi ﬁed using maldi-tof ms in the ﬁrst place (samples were read but not identi ﬁed; note: in 2018/2019, the above-mentioned internal libraries “bdal ”and “filamentous fungi ”did not contain msp of the later identi ﬁed species). due to uncharacteristic macro- and micromorphologies as exempli ﬁed infigure 1 , an unambiguous identi ﬁcation by phenotypic traits was also not possible. therefore, species identity was analyzed by pcr, its sequencing and similarity searches revealing the most common causative agent of hedgehog-dermatophytosis, namelyt. erinacei (n = 8; 16% of the total sample size), and ﬁve different arthroderma spp. (n = 9; 18%) being rare geophiles ( arthroderma (a.) crocatum ,a. quadri ﬁdum,a. insingulare ,a. tuberculatum , a. chiloniense ;table 1 ). a dendrogram based on these its sequences was compiled to show similarities between the analyzed dermatophytes ( figure 2 ). generally, each species formed an own subclade. different originsof isolation, i.e. human-derived (hum) or from veterinary practice(vet–veterinary; vac - vaccine strain) were not re ﬂected. the tree comprised two main clades: the upper one contained allarthroderma s p p . ,t h el o w

andt. quinckeanum were separated in distinct subclades. overall, the its-based dendrogram is inagreement with reliable identi ﬁcation. however, in the case of species identi ﬁcation with the genus arthroderma this figure 3 | sabouraud-dextrose agar (2%) covered with a sterilized ﬁlter paper promoted fungal growth successfully and facilitated sampling of merely fungal material for maldi-tof ms analysis. different trichophyton (t.), arthroderma (a.) and microsporum (m.) isolates are exemplarily shown after an incubation time of 5d at 28°c ( t. verrucosum: 37°c). species identity was con ﬁrmed by sequencing of the its region of fungal rdna.baumbach et al. zoophilic dermatophytes identi ﬁed by maldi-tof ms frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology | www.frontiersin.org april 2021 | volume 11 | article 631681 5identi ﬁcation relies only on its sequences deposited in the ncbi database. maldi-tof ms identi ﬁcation of dermatophytes based on the sequencing results, msps of all of the above- mentioned 17 cultures were created and deposited in the in-houselibrary to facilitate future identi ﬁcation. we obtained best quality raw spectra from the double-measurement of at least 12 replicates ofthe same protein extraction (at least 24 raw spectra) rather than triplicate measurements of 8 rep licates (as recommended by the manufacturer). more measuremen ts per spot lead to less identicalraw spectra that would less likely pass quality control. moreover, with our method using less measurements per spot, themanufacturer-recommended minimal number of raw spectra forthe creation of reliable msps (n = 20) was usually obtained. during further analyses, multiple measurements of cultures gave rise to spectra of varying quality and to variable scores. toﬁnd out whether the poorer scores resulted from different culture conditions (solid vs. liquid) or incubation periods (over-night vs.several days), selected dermatophyte isolates were cultured withboth methods and measured after different incubation times(supplementary table 1 ). the cultivation on solid media was conducted using the above-mentioned ﬁlter papers to reduce figure 4 | examples of mass spectrometric pro ﬁles (raw spectra) of different trichophyton (t.) erinacei -isolates cultured in liquid sabouraud-2% dextrose-broth over-night with gentle rotation at room temperature (liquid, over-night) and on solid agar plates for 3d at 28°c (solid, 3d) are shown. species identi ty was con ﬁrmed by sequencing of the its region of fungal rdna. overall, the mass spectrometric pro ﬁles were very similar for both cultivation methods. for some isolates grown in liquid media, more and/or more intense peaks were observed in the lower mass range (indicated by the black parenthesis). on the other hand, a peak at aro und 7300 m/z (black box) was predominantly found in solid cultures. however, a cluster of peaks around 4000 m/z (blue box) seems somewhat species speci ﬁc for t. erinacei since it was found in most examined isolates regardless of the cultivation method.baumbach et al. zoophilic dermatophytes identi ﬁed by maldi-tof ms frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology |

comparison to primary cultures of clinical samples.using the afore-mentioned bruker libraries only, some of thetested dermatophyte species were not identi ﬁed correctly, e.g. t. verrucosum ort. benhamiae , and often with scores at or below the cutoff value for “probable genus identi ﬁcation ” recommended by the manufacturer ( ≤1.7). liquid cultures mostly obtained higher scores compared to time-matched solidcultures ( supplementary table 1 ). on the other hand, m. canis was identi ﬁed correctly with the internal bruker libraries after growth of subcultures up to 5d using solid and liquid media(supplementary table 1 ). however, t. verrucosum ibml c005 was misidenti ﬁed as t. erinacei with scores above 2 using the bruker database after cultivation on solid medium (not recommended by bruker; supplementary table 1 ). applying the in-house library, a “secure genus identi ﬁcation, probable species identi ﬁcation ”with scores ≥2.0 was usuallycomputed for all cultures of t. verrucosum ,t. benhamiae ,t. erinacei and m. canis g r o w ni nl i q u i da n do ns o l i dm e d i a likewise, provided relatively fresh cultures (up to 5d of growth)were used and time- and cultivation-matched msps wereincluded prior ( supplementary table 1 ). older cultures were more often attributed with poorer scores or not identi ﬁed at all although the most elaborate procedure of sample preparation for maldi-tof ms measurements (i.e. extraction) was performed (data not shown). comparing the three different procedures for sample preparation recommended by the manufacturer (direct transfervs. extended direct transfer vs. extraction), generally, we foundthe extraction method for dermatophytes most successful andhence implemented it for all maldi-tof ms measurements for daily diagnostics. direct and extended direct transfer with the addition of formic acid to the sample on the target plate mostlylead to “no peaks ”and repeated measurements; the modi ﬁed extended direct transfer method as described above often yielded figure 5 | a score-oriented distance dendrogram based on the mass spectrometric data (msp) was generated to identify similarities and clusters

cultivation resulted in more and/or more intense peaks, particularly in the lower mass range up to 4000 m/z ( figure 4 ,t. erinacei ig39 (liquid, over-night) and t. erinacei ig40 (liquid, over-night), black parentheses). however, that was not seen uniformly for all tested isolates of this particularspecies. on the other hand, a cluster of peaks around 4000 m/zseems somewhat species speci ﬁc since this arrangement was seen in most examined isolates ( figure 4 , blue box). interestingly, spectra resulting from cultures grown on solid media exhibited apeak at around 7300 m/z which was not seen in spectra derivedfrom liquid cultures ( figure 4 , black box). in summary, growth time and culture condition have an in ﬂuence on individual raw spectra but not so much on computed scores andspecies identi ﬁcation if relatively fresh cultures are analyzed.distance dendrogram based on maldi-tof ms for similarity and cluster analy ses, msps were used to generate a score-oriented distance dendrogram

isolates of this study were subsequently deposited in the german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures gmbh (dsmz, braunschweig, germa ny) and thoroughly sequenced for deposition in the ncbi blastn database.baumbach et al. zoophilic dermatophytes identi ﬁed by maldi-tof ms frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology | www.frontiersin.org april 2021 | volume 11 | article 631681 8discussion maldi-tof ms previously proofed a rapid, accurate and reliable method for the identi ﬁcation of microorganisms in clinical settings and basic research. in the last years, thespectrum of species that are readily identi ﬁable increased substantially due to technical re ﬁnements, methodological adaptations and constant extension of reference databases(cassagne et al., 2016 ). here, we can report of a good maldi- tof ms performance for the identi ﬁcation of the most common zoophilic dermatophyte m. canis (nenoff et al., 2014b ). however, when it comes to less frequent or uncommon causative agents,maldi-tof ms still reaches its limits quickly due to incomplete reference data bases ( croxatto et al., 2012 ;biswas and rolain, 2013 ;sacheli et al., 2020 ). recollecting from our recent routine laboratory diagnostics, of the zoophilic dermatophytes only m. canis was identi ﬁed reliably with trustworthy scores (n = 10, score ≥2.0) and identical next best hits using the provided libraries (bdal, filamentous fungi, bruker daltonik gmbh). supposedly, the high number of deposited spectra of different m. canis -isolates (n = 11; 11/20/2020) enables this fast and correct identi ﬁcation. for t. erinacei , the most common causative agent of dermatophytoses in hedgehogs, the latter was dif ﬁcult probably because as few as two reference spectra were only recentlyintroduced to the bruker libraries. within the bruker maldi-tof ms system, the libraries are based on an isolate-speci ﬁc reference approach in which spectral data are computed from replicates of the same isolate. differentreferences are not linked and do not in ﬂuence each other as opposed to the taxonomical group-speci ﬁc approach pursued by other systems, e.g. axima@sar amis (shimadzu/anagnostec, duisburg, germany) and vitek ms (biome ́rieux, marcy ‐l´ e ́toile, france). although this isolate-speci ﬁc approach relies on the correct species identi ﬁcation prior to deposition in the library, it enables the entry of new, customized referencesimmensely, which is a huge advantage in speeding up routinework ﬂows ( cassagne et al., 2016 ). after creation of msps of the above-mentioned t. erinacei -isolates and deposition in the in- house library, identi ﬁcation of such samples became a lot more successful. a designated, larger test cohort comprising amongothers different zoophilic dermatophytes not used for mspcreation will be assessed in the near future to con ﬁrm the reliability of the in-house library in a broader context. interestingly, although the bruker databases comprised quite a few spectra of the genus arthroderma , our samples were not identi ﬁed in the ﬁrst place; only dna sequencing provided full account of the different arthroderma spp. dermatophytoses is often asymptomatic in hedgehogs (66% in our cohort) but ifspines are affected and ultimately lost, it may also be lethal anddemands special medical attention including the correctidenti ﬁcation of disease-causing agents ( weishaupt et al., 2014 ; abarca et al., 2017 ). moreover, since pet-hedgehogs have increased in popularity, the transmission of t. erinacei - infections to humans is also increasingly reported ( abarca et al., 2017 ;gebauer et al., 2018 ;kargl et al., 2018 ;wiegandet al., 2019 ). the genus arthroderma comprises anthropophilic, zoophilic and geophilic species as well ( de hoog et al., 2017 ), rendering a zoonotic transmission and human infection alsohighly likely. we ascribe the unexpected multitude of dermatophyte species isolated from the hedgehogs in our study to their way of life. however, the high prevalence in this cohort of animals might also be related to their poor health status. critical factors for maldi-tof ms-based dermatophyte identi ﬁcation include cultural features (media, incubation time) and sample preparation (method, matrix) as well asdermatophyte (species reso lution, taxonomy) and mass spectrometer/system characteristics (instrument, library; l’ollivier and ranque, 2017 ). concerning the media used, although one might expect different protein expression pro ﬁles of dermatophytes grown on different media as a thigmotropic or nutritional response tocertain environmental conditions, many studies describe no or negligible effects of different media compositions on the maldi- tof-ms identi ﬁcation performance ( theel et al., 2011 ;l’ollivier et al., 2013 ;bartosch et al., 2018 ). however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study describing the comparison of solid vs. liquid media formulations. in our study, the usage of liquid media for species identi ﬁcation and/or msp generation did not prove superior to solid media covered with a ﬁlter paper. spectra obtained from both growth conditions were equally well identi ﬁed using the in- house library and, hence, the more fastidious liquid culturemethod was not pursued further. this is mainly due tohandling inquiries during sample preparation, e.g. even multiplecentrifugation steps did not ensure complete removal of culture media and washing buffer. also, for some isolates no growth was observed even after a prolonged incubation time. we agreefurthermore with our colleagues that 1) contaminations are notas easily identi ﬁed in liquid cultures and 2) this procedure seems inconvenient to be integrated into a routine work ﬂow for fast diagnostics ( lau et al., 2019 ;sacheli et al., 2020 ). indeed, for some isolates more and/or more intense peaks/spectrum were obtained which might result in a higher speci ﬁcity for msp creation but this was not seen generally. in accordance with others, our studyproves that cultures grown on solid media also produce high-quality spectra and good identi ﬁcation scores ( respinis et al., 2014 ;sacheli et al., 2020 ). the ﬁlter paper ensured neat sampling of merely fungal material without protraction of agar and proved a fast and cost-effective alternative to other commercially available growth media provided with a membrane, as e.g. id-fungi plates(idfp; conidia, quincieux, france). indeed, these plates weredescribed to promote faster growth of ﬁlamentous fungi due to an optimized composition and ph ( heireman et al., 2020 )b u tw e did not notice any growth dif ﬁculties with the isolates tested during our study. even t. verrucosum , which is especially slow growing and demanding ( kane and smitka, 1978 ), could be harvested unproblematic ally already after a few days of cultivation. nevertheless, idfp might represent analternative for otherwise fas tidious isolates with special nutritional requirements.baumbach et al. zoophilic dermatophytes identi ﬁed by maldi-tof ms frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology | www.frontiersin.org april 2021 | volume 11 | article 631681 9regarding the incubation time of dermatophyte cultures, in accordance with others we observed better identi ﬁcation scores with younger cultures (over-night in liquid broth or up to 5d onsolid media; l’ollivier et al., 2013 ). we attribute this to the fact that all entries in the relevant bruker libraries are establishedusing cultures handled according to the “liquid cultivation procedure ”, i.e. only over-night-incubation probably leading to more similar protein expression pro ﬁles to younger cultures (pers. comm. with bruker daltonik gmbh). the reliableidenti ﬁc a t i o na f t e rs u c hs h o r ti n c u b a t i o nt i m e s-b e f o r e characteristic morphological traits of fungi are displayed - isone of the main advantages of maldi-tof ms ( l’ollivier et al., 2013 ). interestingly, others report of higher identi ﬁcation rates with older cultures (up to 14d of incubation) which might beexplained with the production of secondary metabolites that areusually only found in mature cultures ( coulibaly et al., 2011 ; packeu et al., 2014 ). we therefore recommend to include cultures of the relevant species of different incubation times into one ’s own library to circumvent these complications. both dendrograms, i.e. based on its-sequences and on msp data, support the often-described close relation of dermatophytesaltogether and within the different genera ( de hoog et al., 2017 ). two main clades are formed in both trees separating geophilic and zoophilic dermatophyte species almost completely. in themaldi-tof ms dendrogram, the majority of the geophilic species cluster in the lower clade; the a. tuberculatum -isolates are located directly next to this clade and, in terms of subclades,separated from the zoophilic species. in the its-dendrogram, theseparation between geophiles and zoophiles is even sharper withboth groups forming distinct subclades. here, furthermore, each species forms its own subclade; this is also seen in the maldi-tof ms dendrogram apart from t. verrucosum with one isolate clustering together with the veterinary t. erinacei -isolates. however, the nested arrangement of t. erinacei ,t. verrucosum and t. benhamiae together in one subcluster in the msp-dendrogram underlines their closeinterspecies-relation which is not only seen in other proteomeanalyses (bartosch et al, 2018) but also reported in other genomic studies ( gräser et al., 2008 ;baumbach et al., 2020 ). furthermore, the latter is also supported by the current its-tree in which thesethree species form one common subclade as well. t. mentagrophytes forms a subclade with t. quinckeanum in both trees; the latter was only recently separated from the t. mentagrophytes- complex and classi ﬁed as an independent species rather than a variant ( uhrlaß et al., 2018 ). interestingly, their seems to be a close relation to m. canis as well since the latter isolates are found in close proximity to t. mentagrophytes andt. quinckeanum in both trees. in the maldi-tof ms dendrogram, the t. erinacei -isolates subcluster according to the host they were isolated from, i.e. allveterinary and all human isolates form distinct subclades. also, a. insingulare anda. crocatum show this separation according to the origin of isolation. this phenomenon is not observed in thecurrent its-dendrogram and was also not seen in a previousstudy with t. benhamiae -isolates derived from human patients and infected guinea pigs ( baumbach et al., 2020 ). however, fort. erinacei this may be explained with the different geographical sampling sites of these isolates (human: central germany;hedgehog: hannover area). the overall distribution and organization in common subclades among the arthroderma - i s o l a t e si sv e r ys i m i l a ri nb o t h dendrograms: a. chiloniense and a. crocatum form a common subclade as well as a. insingulare anda. quadri ﬁdum; as mentioned before, the a. tuberculatum -isolates are somewhat separated from the other arthroderma spp. brasch et al. identi ﬁed a rather remote position for a. quadri ﬁdum and, furthermore, quite a distance between the former and a. insingulare in another its-based phylogenetic analysis but they included only one isolate of each investigated species ( brasch et al., 2019 ). however, similar to the zoophilic dermatophyte, the interspeci ﬁcs e q u e n c ed i v e r g e n c ei nt h e genus arthroderma does not exceed 2% ( brasch et al., 2019 ). although s. brevicaulis is a mold of the microascus genus, it was grouped into one of the main clades of the msp-dendrogramand not as a real outgroup. s. brevicaulis is regularly isolated from nail infections and, hence, typically associated with mold- related onychomycosis; keratinolytic activities are well reported(issakainen et al., 2007 ;macura and sko ́ra, 2015 ). although the majority of the extracted proteins for maldi-tof ms areribosomal proteins rather than secreted proteases, this similarlifestyle compared to dermatophytes may explain the position ofs. brevicaulis in the dendrogram. in conclusion, our results suggest that maldi-tof ms is a suitable method for the identi ﬁcation and differentiation of zoophilic dermatophytes provided that the reference library issupplemented with laboratory-relevant species, underrepresentedand uncommon taxa, and suf ﬁcient isolates per species to circumvent the observed intraspecies diversity and cultivation variations ( theel et al., 2011 ;croxatto et al., 2012 ;respinis et al., 2013 ;l’ollivier and ranque, 2017 ).to further improve identi ﬁcation rates, we recommend taking the list of the next best hits from the mass spectrometer identi ﬁcation score matching chart into consideration to conclude secured results. furthermore,combination with its sequencing is advisable in critical cases. data availability statement the datasets presented in this study can be found in onlinerepositories. the names of the repository/repositories andaccession

it can be argued that the taxonomy of dermatophytes, in particular that of anthropophilic species, is sufficiently established and stable for the benefit of both clinicians and scientists. 1. introduction. 2. first dermatophyte classification systems. 3. phenotypic classification systems. 4. “biological” era in the classification. 5. eco logical division of dermatophytes. 6. molecular revolution in the taxonomy of dermatophytes. 7. taxonomic problems in mycology. 8. cli nical aspect of the taxonomy of dermatophytes. 9. current classification system. 10. indistinguishable «species complexes». 11. summary taksonomia dermatofitów – systemy klasyfikacyjne się zmieniają, problemy identyfikacyjne pozostają te same streszczenie: infekcje grzybicze skóry, włosów i paznokci cechuje najwyższa prewalencja wśród wszystkich grzybic dotykając obecnie ponad 20–25% populacji ludzi i zwierząt na świecie. czynnikami etiologicznymi większości grzybiczych infekcji powierzchniowych są dermatofity. spośród innych patogennych grzybów strzępkowych wyróżnia je unikalna właściwość rozkładu keratyny. ogromna zdolność przetrwania w różnych ekosystemach grzybów tej grupy wynika z ich różnorodności morfologicznej, ekologicznej, jak również możli - wości adaptacji do zmieniających się warunków środowiska. dermatofity chociaż stanowią jedna z najstarszych grup mikroorganizmów długo nie doczekały się stabilnego systemu taksonomicznego. co najważniejsze z klinicznego punktu widzenia, dermatofity wciąż przy - sparzają problemów diagnostycznych, co skutkuje błędami terapeutycznymi. rosnąca liczba zakażeń, w tym również odzwierzęcych, brak stabilności taksonomicznej i niejednoznaczny obraz kliniczny niektórych przypadków dermatomykoz powodują konieczność poszukiwa - nia nowych metod szybkiej, taniej i powtarzalnej identyfikacji gatunkowej tych grzybów. z kolei identyfikacja gatunkowa determinowana jest jasnością kryteriów klasyfikacyjnych uwzględniających poglądy klinicystów, epidemiologów i mykologów. w niniejszej pracy autorzy przedstawiają ewolucję systemów taksonomicznych dermatofitów na przestrzeni dziejów rozwoju mikrobiologii. odkrywanie nowych faktów z zakresu biologii i ekologii dermatofitów, jak również rozwój technik możliwych do zastosowania w laboratorium diagnostyki mykologicznej skutkowały opracowaniem nowych strategii identyfikacyjnych. współczesny system klasyfikacyjny tych patogenów oparty na badaniach molekularnych wydaje się być stabilny i szeroko akceptowany, czy jednak zakończy wiekowe zamieszanie klasyfikacyjne i okres setek zmian nomenklaturowych, będących koszmarem diagnostów?

[28] des cribe dermatophytes as a large group of closely r elated keratinophilic fungi of the genus epidermo - phyton (sabour. 1907), microsporum (fat 1843) an d tricho ph yton (malmsten 1848), which cause infections of skin, hair, nails and other products of the epidermi s a nd dermis. all dermatophyte species belong to th e a rthrodermataceae family (locq. ex currah 1985) and the order onygenales (cif. ex benny and kimbr. 1980). within a definition drawn in such a way, doubts ar e ra ised when terming dermatophytes and saprophyt ic s pecies of these types as non-pathogenic, e.g. epider - mophyton stockdaleae (prochacki and eng.-zas. 1974), microsporum boullardi (dominik and majchr . 1965), t richophyton ajelloi (ajello 1968), t. terrestre (dur ie and d. frey 1957). the term “dermatophytoids” [32, 34] wa s proposed in order to distinguish these non- p athogenic species from the pathogens proper and t o in dicate their biological connection at the same time. 2.first dermatophyte classification systems dermatophytes were described as one of the firs t micr oorganisms being pathogenic agents of the then observed skin lesions in humans and animals [34]. taxonomic studies of these fungi were initiated in 1841 by robert remak and david gruby [26]. the five main species of dermatophytes recognised today as epidemiologically the most important ones, namely microsporum audouinii (gruby 1843), epidermophyton floccosum (langeron and miloch. 1930), trichophyton schoenleinii (langeron and miloch. ex nann. 1934), t. tonsurans (malmsten 1848) and t. mentagrophytes (sabour. 1895) were described over the period of 1841–1875 [51]. i t is worth mentioning that the firs t c lassification of dermatophytes was compiled severa l de cades before louis pasteur developed the method o f o btaining pure cultures, which indicates how signifi - cant the observation of dermatomycosis in those da ys wa s [51]. trichophyton rubrum is the only known der - matophyte, which is missing from the list of r. rem at and d. gruby (sabour, 1911) and was only classified in the twentieth century [49]. breeding and description of pure dermatophyte cultures helped mycology enter a period comparable to the renaissance. newly classified dermatophytes were determined on the basis of combined observa - tions of different clinical changes of the ringworm caused by various ecological groups of dermato- phytes and descriptions of the morphology of colonies performed in vitro [50]. using sabouraud’s metho - do logy as a standard [50], in 1870–1920, further six - teen species of dermatophytes were identified, mainly associated with human infections. applying the same methodological standard to the classification of der- matophytes led to an increase in the number of descrip - tions of new species and nomenclature confusion in the following decades. the general concept of deter - mining membership in the dermatophyte group was disturbed and taxonomic rules became inconsistent, resulting in multiple changes in the nomenclature. in 1950 this brought about 350 changes in species names (fig. 1) [12]. cl assification rules for derma - tophytes and consistent nomenclature of anamorphs were established only after extensive consultations in the community of mycologists, and the genera epi- fig. 1. number of nomenclature changes of dermatophyte species with the criterion of classification and development period of taxonomy. retractedtaksonomia dermatofitów – systemy klasyfikacyjne zmieniają się... 51 dermophyton , microsporum and trichophyton became taxa gathering all previously known species of derma - tophytes [11, 12, 60]. 3. phenotypic classification systems pasteur’s method of obtaining pure cultures was quickly implemented in mycology and taxonomy of dermatophytes [51]. the morphology of a single fun - gal colony constituted good diagnostic parameters in combination with its microscopic image [11]. doubts about the possibility of using descriptions of macro and micromorphologies of pure cultures in the iden - tification of dermatophytes appeared only during the tests of the repeatability of these traits [22, 34, 60]. it was proven that isolates derived directly from clinical changes feature characteristic morphology, which is diagnostically useful. at the same time this morpho log y changes as a result of culture passaging [11, 12, 18]. the standardisation of reference strains was therefore diffi - cult, which in turn led to the introduction of numerous taxa, which, however, are now considered synonymous with the previously described species [12, 64]. at pre - sent, only with historical significance, at least twenty different synonymous species names can be indicated for t. mentagrophytes , six t. verrusosum (e. b odin 1902) and three for m. canis and e. floccosum . additionally, various types of morphological variations have been described as separate taxa, e.g. keratinomyces longi - fusus (flórián and galgoczy 1964), which is actually microsporum fulvum (uriburu 1909) characterised by strongly coherent conidia [41]. incorrect classification was therefore an unavoid - able consequence of a diagnostic system based solely on the phenotype [16, 17, 22, 66]. moreover, there are at least a few species of dermatophytes which do not show sporulation at all or sporulate very poorly in in vitro culture. such species can certainly include trichophy - ton concentricum (r. b lanch. 1895) and t. schoenleinii (langeron and miloch. ex nann. 1934), which due to the lack of specific phenotypic traits in in vitro cultures are often identified based on the characteristic image and location of clinical changes [12, 29]. in the last decades of the twentieth century, it became evident that species-based identification based on morphology has its limitations and cannot be fur - ther used. that is why weitzman et a l. [59] introduced an additional set of physiological tests to the diagnosis of dermatophytes. the use of so-called “ trichophyton- agar ” allowed one to demonstrate the variation in the ability of individual strains to assimilate the vitamin panel. in addition, the ability to grow at different tem - peratures and the ability to liquefy gelatine resulted in the introduction of additional criteria in the differen-tiation of isolates. the new “conventional approach” applied in the description of dermatophyte species was a combination of the clinical picture of infection, macro s copic and microscopic features of pure cultures and their physiology. the only aspect which has not been taken into consideration in this approach was strain serology, which has never really been introduced into the diagnosis of dermatophytes [11, 15, 32]. 4. “ biological” era in the classification descriptions of teleomorphic phases of dermato - phytes by christine dawson, jeremy gentles [9] and phylis stockdale [52] led to the introduction of the biological concept of species into mycology. these researchers claimed that some geophilic and zoophilic dermatophytes, as well as related non-pathogenic spe - cies such as trichophyton terrestre and t. ajelloi , repro - duce in a sexual process. in order to determine the phases of the perfect (teleomorphic) fungi, the generic names arthroderma (curr. 1860) and nannizzia were introduced (stockdale 1961) [9, 11, 52, 53]. as a con - sequence, the number of taxa increased, and the clas - sification and identification became complicated by the introduction of a double nomenclature for these fungi (fig. 2). the determination of sexual types among der - matophytes began in an unusual way when stockdale [53] discovered that in the representatives of many, seemingly unrelated, species the sexual process can be induced in the presence of the test strain arthroderma simii (stockdale, dwr mack and austwick 1965). most species of dermatophytes, whose perfect (teleomorphic) stages are known, can be identified with this method. in the course of the conducted research it turned out that trichophyton rubrum possesses the mating type known as (–), while a closely related species t. megninii (r. b lanch. 1895), currently used as a synonym of the former, is of the (+) mating type [52, 53]. teleomorphic stages have not yet been described for only a few epide - miologically important species of dermatophytes, such as epidermophyton floccosum (langeron and miloch. 193) and t. soudanense (joyeux 1912) [11]. summerbell [55] pointed out the obvious ecological factor linking species with unknown teleomorphic stages, namely, all of them were capable of causing infection in animals and/or humans. however, to date, no reproductive structures have been found on keratin plant or animal remains that would allow them to undergo sexual pro- cesses later on. the knowledge of the genome sequences of many dermatophyte species allowed for determining the loci responsible for mating types [36]. using partial amplification of each locus , kano et a l. [31] confirmed molecularly that the 22 tested strains of t. verrucosum retracted52 sebastian gnat, aneta now akiewicz, przemysław zięba exhibit only one mating type. other scientific reports [11, 12, 25] revealed that a single mating type occurs in many species, including: t. tonsurans (malmsten 1848), t. equinum (gedoelst 1902), t. interdigitale (priestley 1917), t. schoenleinii (langeron & miloch. ex nann. 1934), t. rubrum, t. violaceum (sabour, ex e.bodin 1902), t. erinacei (aa padhye and jw car - mich. 1969), t. concentricum , m. audouinii and m. fer- rugineum (m. ota 1921). it corroborates the view tha t the dominant method of reproduction among thes e f ungi is asexual clonal reproduction, which appeared as a consequence of losing one of the mating types (+) o r (–) a t the species level [12, 31, 36]. the only exceptio n a re zoophilic species, such as t. benhamiae (y . gräser and de hoog 2016) and t. mentagrophytes , where bot h t ypes were present, but in different proportion s [56, 57]. b ased on these studies, it may be inferred tha t c lonal asexual processes are the dominant reproduc - tion method of all anthropophilic dermatophytes an d m ost zoophilic ones [12, 36]. the difference in the types of the propagules of asexual reproduction (conidi a), dep endent on the life stage of the fungus, should b e em phasised [16, 19]. while developing within ha iro r epidermal structures, the fungal hyphae undergo fragmentation in order to produce a number of small, persistent arthroconidia, which also constitute infec - tious elements [40]. in turn, the asexual reproduc- tion of fungi in vitro yields a completely different gene - ration of spores, defined by macro and microconidia [11, 16, 17, 21, 22]. anzawa et al. [2] made some interesting observa - tions and demonstrated the possibility of the sexual process between the highly competent a. simii test strain producing a fertile generation and t. rubrum strain. as a result of crossbreeding between these strains, ascospores were obtained, one of which turned out to be a hybrid of both crossbred strains of these two species. it seems that dermatophytes obtained an atavistic ability to exchange genetic material as a result of sexual reproduction in response to unfavourable conditions, e.g. stressful conditions of a newly settled (colonised) environment [12]. in fact, different ecolog - ical niches in the case of anthropophilic ( t. rubrum ) and zoophilic ( a. simii ) species limit the possibility of encountering strains with different ecological prefer - ences in nature [2]. fig. 2. representatives of species and their importance in the history of taxonomy of dermatophytes. retractedtaksonomia dermatofitów – systemy klasyfikacyjne zmieniają się... 53 5. e cological division of dermatophytes considerable differences between the species of dermatophytes can be seen in relation to their natu - ral habitat. three ecological groups of dermatophytes have been described so far: anthropophilic, zoophilic and geophilic (table i). it is often impossible to classify individual species to an ecological type due to insuffi - cient phenotypic differences and the lack of a molecular determinant [40, 43, 44]. anthropophilic species colo - nise the products of the human epidermis in a natural way, moving between hosts and causing chronic but mild infections, mainly within the homo sapiens spe - cies [15, 40]. transmission of infection to animals, albeit sporadic, is considered possible [40]. zoophilic species live on animals, but their trans - fer to humans is possible and frequent. it usually takes place through reservoirs, which may be the animals themselves, their fur or objects they came into con - tact with [16–20, 40, 43, 44]. zoophilic dermatophytes isolated from animals are responsible for symptomatic infections, but they are also often asymptomatic, mak - ing an animal a carrier. in this case they may become a source of epidemics [19, 20]. the natural place where geophilic dermatophytes dwell is soil, often around habitats (burrows, caves) of specific terrestrial mam - mals [5]. this group of fungi can be transmitted by ani - mals mechanically on the outer coverings [5, 15, 19], imitating asymptomatic carriage, hence the difference between geophilic and zoophilic dermatophytes is not always clear. additionally, when the transmission onto a human takes place, zoo and geophilic species cause acute mycoses with strongly expressed symptoms of inflammatory response [16, 20, 22]. scientific evidence points to the phenomenon of high infectivity of zoo - philic dermatomycoses among humans. they often lead to the formation of acute foci of infection with a dis- tinct ring along the edge of the lesion, which indicates a strong inflammatory process [20, 54]. in turn, most of the infections caused by geophilic dermatophytes are mild and the foci are of self-limiting character [15, 54]. during the recent studies on the phylogeny of dermatophytes, an evolutionary tendency has been observed, indicating a noticeable adaptive trend, from the oldest geophilic dermatophytes through zoophilic to anthropophilic dermatophytes. the last one on the list is considered to be the youngest evolutionarily, the least adapted to various ecological niches, and at the same time narrowly specialised for development on human skin [27, 64]. the biological explanation of this phenom - enon seems to be simple. adaptation to life in a constant host tissue environment resulted in the secondary loss of many adaptive mechanisms, which is clearly notice-able in the loss of e.g. mating types in anthropophilic species [25, 64]. however, geophilic dermatophytes, living in variable soil conditions and subjected to con - tinuous competition from other microorganisms, show a number of adaptive features, including the capability of sexual reproduction [2, 64]. zoophilic dermatophytes constitute the intermediate link. the animal fur coat is more difficult to control as an ecological niche for fungi than the keratinised human tissues, but it is cer - tainly milder than the soil exposed to changing physio- chemical conditions [47, 64]. it seems that the common ancestor of all dermatophytes should be sought among geophilic species [25, 63]. the characteristics of indi - vidual dermatophyte groups, presented in such a way, designate three ecological types, which have fundamen - tally different adaptation to the natural habitat and also have other clinical significance (table i), even though they are not clearly phenotypically distinguishable. 6. m olecular revolution in the taxonomy o f dermatophytes in the last decade of the 20th century the use of molecular methods revolutionised the taxonomy of der- matophytes and other fungi, just as in the times of louis pasteur, when pure cultures revolutionised microbio - logy. the first molecular markers in mycology were dna sequences encoding proteins of small and large ribosome subunit [23, 33, 39, 47, 61]. gräser et a l. [22, 24] used the its rdna (internal transcribed spacer ribosomal dna) in the taxonomic studies of fungi, which allowed them to classify a significant number of species. this molecular marker was repeatedly used in later studies [10, 16–20, 25, 35, 42, 61, 63, 66], also evolutionary origin di stant in termediate c lose sexual process l ack p ossible f requent infectious changes li ttle m oderate s evere source of infection h uman a nimals (also possible environment) en vironment (mainly soil) treatment c hronic e asy, short s elf-healingtable i characteristics of ecological groups of dermatophytes characteristicecological group anthropophile zoophile geophile retracted54 sebastian gnat, aneta now akiewicz, przemysław zięba in combination with other ones, such as the tubulin beta gene [47, 48] or the gene of the translational fac - tor 1 [38]. based on these studies, it was found that the main topology of the arthrodermataceae family is molecularly stable, but does not fully correspond to the morphology, because the genus trichophyton appears to be polyphyletic [24, 38, 47, 48]. phylogenetically, anthropophilic species of dermatophytes are evolution - arily the youngest ones and are limited to several closed clusters, whereas zoophilic species, especially those infecting farm animals, hold the intermediate position in terms of the evolutionary age, constituting a link that connects them with the ancestors – geophilic species [12]. the new taxonomic system formalised these dif - ferences in evolutionary origin, which was intended to translate into greater utility in laboratory diagnostics. while the molecular approach to the taxonomy of dermatophytes was able to determine the main trends of their evolution, it turned out to be unreliable in the classification and identification of several epidemio - logically relevant species [25]. pairs of species which are established in mycology, such as trichophyton rubrum /t. violaceum , t. equinum /t. tonsurans and also, to some extent, the trio of m. audouinii /m. canis /m. fer- rugineum remained indistinguishable molecularly, even with the employment of multilocus analysis [12]. because of this, the only solution to this taxonomic problem can be a multi-directional approach which combines molecular, ecological and phenotypic data, and also takes into account the life cycles of these fungi. 7. t axonomic problems in mycology the main taxonomic problem which is often found in the case of environmental fungi, is the unexpected diversity of phylogenetic isolates, which earlier appeared to be phenotypically monomorphic [22, 25, 63, 64]. the isolates with a similar macro and micro-morphology are repeatedly proven to belong to completely different species, genera and even ecological groups [22, 40, 60]. it is necessary to indicate that dermatophytes classified according to phenotype, despite the differentiation of traits within equivalent taxa, always belong to one evo - lutionary lineage, that is arthrodermataceae family [25]. the common phylogeny of all dermatophytes can be demonstrated by their keratinophilic properties, which represent a rare feature in the kingdom of fungi [64]. in turn, the evolution within this family shows strong coherence with natural hosts, animals or humans sup- plying the basic nutrient-keratin [63]. the relationship between the dermatophyte species and the host has been reported in the literature long before the introduc - tion of molecular methods into the taxonomy, and the reasons are seen in the diversification of keratin struc -ture in particular host species and the phenomenon of the pathogen’s adaptation to the host [8]. the second currently relevant taxonomic problem in mycology is the concept of molecular species [22, 25]. many years after the introduction of the genetic crite-rion into taxonomy, the rule stating that in the kingdom of fungi the number of species determined on the basis of molecular research is much higher than that defined on the basis of conventional phenotypic methods was in force [3, 13, 21]. literature provides data in rela - tion to the multiplicity of the genetic types of aspergil - lus fumigatus (fresen. 1863) [3], candida parapsilosis (langeron and talice 1932) [13] or aureobasidium pul - lulans (g. a rnaud 1918) [21], which confirm this view. dermatophytes, however, seem to be unique in this respect. in the last 150 years of mycological research, concentrated mainly in european centres due to the high frequency and variety of diseases caused by these fungi, a large number of phenotypes and genotypes of dermatophytes has been described [21]. currently, 10 species of anthropophilic dermatophytes have been identified on the european continent, based on genetic criteria [12]. however, 103 taxa of this type are listed in atlas of clinical fungi [11, 12], and in the literature researchers use as many as 242 synonymous names to describe the same 10 species [12, 15]. thus, it seems that in the case of dermatophytes species diversity observed on the basis of the results of classical identification is much greater than the genetic diversity actually existing. we can conclude that anthropophilic, and presumably also zoophilic, dermatophytes were artificially classified, which led to the accumulation of equivalent taxa, with - out phylogenetic justification [64]. similar phenomena of inflating the number of species are visible in other fungi groups of practical significance, which were there - fore investigated in extenso. for example, the species of rhizopus (ehrenb. 1821) grow easily in in vitro culture, and their industrial use began immediately after the pasteur period, due to their important role in the fer - mentation processes of asian soy-based food products [30]. 43 synonymous species of rhizopus microsporus have been described phenotypically (tiegh. 1875) as well as r. arrhizus (a. f isch. 1892), which were molecu - larly reduced to only two [14]. another example is the ubiquitous alternaria alternata (keissl. 1912), reduced to one species on the basis of genomic analyses, from originally numerous synonymous species isolated on the basis of conidia and conidiophore morphology [62]. 8. clinical aspect of the taxonomy of dermatophytes currently three main types of dermatophytes such as epidermophyton , microsporum and trichophyton are classified on the basis of morphological characteristics. retractedtaksonomia dermatofitów – systemy klasyfikacyjne zmieniają się... 55 it only partially corresponds to their phylogenesis [22]. the best example are species belonging to the genus of trichophyton, in which, despite the fact that the fungi meeting the morphological criteria are classified, the anthropophilic and zoophilic dermatophytes are partly located, and partly also their ancestors which are mostly geophilic species [23, 24]. therefore, an array of geo - philic species of trichophyton , phylogenetically distant from representatives of the two other ecological groups and almost never causing infections in humans and ani - mals, is currently considered in routine diagnostics on a par with pathogens [12, 15, 22]. from an ecological and clinical point of view, the difference between these groups is huge because anthropophilic and zoophilic species are considered to be “true” (obligatory) patho - gens, due to the fact that they have an evolutionary advantage and are transferred between humans or their transmission takes place from animals to humans [27, 64]. however, the overwhelming majority of geophilic species are opportunists, and their natural habitat is soil [60]. the combination of such highly evolutionarily distant fungi of one type is not optimal and can lead to diagnostic errors. molecular phylogenesis clearly sep - arates geophilic dermatophytes from anthropophilic and zoophilic ones, which is confirmed by previously published studies based on analysis of its sequence [22], the translational factor 1 gene ( tef1) [38] and the calmodulin gene ( cal) [1]. a system of derma - tophyte taxonomy, being useful in clinical diagnostics and constituting a modern understanding of identifi - cation, needs to reflect molecular phylogeny, addition - ally supported by data from phenotypic studies and assessment of the clinical picture – thus it should be omnidirectional [12]. the main criteria for the opti - mal determination of species should be based on the concept of biological species, i.e. the possibility of ran - dom mating between strains of the same species and producing fertile offspring as well as the lack of such possibility between separate species [43, 44]. in micro - biological practice, however, this criterion is not often easy to apply. sexual crossbreeding experiments were particularly helpful in identifying the species micro - sporum gypseum (guiart and grigoraki 1928) and the t. mentagrophytes complex [56–58]. sexual reproduc - tion of many species of dermatophytes has often no t b een described ex vivo because the conditions, in which teleomorphs are produced, are unknown or possibl y s pecific environmental conditions for this proces s do n ot exist naturally [25, 43, 44]. in the case of the popu - lation of these fungi, the prevalence of one mating typecan lead to the preference for asexual reproduction andcan explain the lack of intraspecies diversit y [22, 25]. th en the species will be a population of individuals with a high degree of genetic compatibility, and the concep t o f biological species will be expressed in silico on th eb asis of genomic similarity analysis [22, 64]. using this concept, de hoog et al . [12] proposed a system of der - matophyte taxonomy which is based on the sequences of the four regions of the genome: its fragment, ribo - somal 60s fragment, gene of large ribosomal subunit (lsu ) and beta-tubulin gene ( tub). each of them was characterised by a different specificity, enabling the identification of different number of taxa accord - ing to the dependence of its > tub > 60s > lsu [12]. the results of these studies indicate that the its rdna sequence is sufficiently informative for dermatophyte genomic analyses, thus constituting an optimal marker in routine diagnostics, although it is necessary to base the species identification on the analysis of additional genes and phenotypic traits [12] to distinguish indi - vidual varietas of some “species complexes” . 9.current classification system the conclusions from mycological workshops orga- nised in 2016 by cbs knaw fungal biodiversity centre (the centraalbureau voor schimmelcultures fungal biodiversity centre, institute of the royal nether lands academy of arts and sciences) in utrecht, the netherlands, enabled the team led by sybrena de hoog [12], to propose a new classification system for dermatophytes based mainly on the molecular crite - rion. the taxonomic relationship between the mem - bers of the arthrodermataceae family in this system is presented in a model way by a phylogenetic tree con-structed on the basis of the analyses of the its sequence located within the rdna (fig. 3). one c an distinguish seven main clades within the phylogram included. the largest one of these includes species of the genus tricho - phyton , characterised by a polyphyletic evolutionary origin. within this genus there are four collective spe - cies (morphologically variable): trichophyton menta - grophytes complex, trichophyton benhamiae complex (y . gräser and de hoog 2016), trichophyton bullosum (lebasque 1933) and trichophyton rubrum complex. the second clade contains a single species epidermo - phyton floccosum , which is paraphyletic and evolution - arily distant from other dermatophytes. a separate clade contains dermatophytes classified as microsporum canis complex, and the other three include the genera of lophophyton (matr. and dassonv. 1899), para- phyton (y . gräser, dukik and de hoog 2016) and nan- nizzia (stockdale 1961). the most diverse clade contains many species currently known under the teleomorphic name of arthroderma . the external branch of the phy - lo genetic tree is the new taxon of the guarromyces (y . gräser and de hoog 2016), to which the previously described anthropophilic species of keratinomyces cere - tanicus has been transferred. retracted56 sebastian gnat, aneta now akiewicz, przemysław zięba 10. i ndistinguishable “species complexes” so-called “species complexes” , which have been dif - ferentiated on the basis of its sequence analysis within the rdna, constitute a taxon of a higher rank gathering the species which are indistinguishable at the level of its [12, 15]. chen et a l. [6] defined a species complex as a population of different species which are doubt - fully distinct. in the case of dermatophytes, a species complex means a taxon that differs genomically in an unambiguous way from other taxa of species rank, while, using the same criterion, there is no differentia- tion between individual species which are included in the composition of the complex [12, 25, 35, 47]. the greatest difficulty in differentiating species within a species complex is the ecological specificity of dermatophytes. let us consider the t. mentagrophytes complex, being a genomically consistent complex of the species t. mentagrophytes and t. interdigitale (priestley 1917) [22]. these two species show completely separate ecological adaptations, as the first of them is strictly anthropophilic, the second – zoophilic [22]. similarly, the classification criterion based on its rdna does not allow zoophilic differentiation of t. equinum from anthropophilic t. tonsurans [12, 22]. the above-men - tioned examples touch upon the fundamental problem in medical mycology, since it is believed that the infec - tion caused by zoophilic dermatophytes in humans has an acute course with significant inflammation, as opposed to benign dermatomycoses, whose etiological factors are anthropophilic species [5]. reliable establish - ment of the boundaries of dermatophyte species, and thus accurate species identification, requires a multi - directional approach. then the cumulative analysis of molecular, phenotypic and clinical data will allow for determining the biological framework of individual taxa of dermatophytes in this taxon in accordance with the ecological specificity of this group of fungi [12, 16, 18–20]. without doubt, further detailed research on this subject is necessary. 11. summary it can be concluded that the taxonomy of derma - tophytes, especially of the anthropophilic species, is already mature enough to achieve stabilisation for the benefit of clinicians. the currently defined taxa will probably not undergo drastic changes in the near future, and the presented phylogeny will not turn out to be wrong in the course of ongoing research. has the stability of the nomenclature for dermatophytes been finally achieved? an overview of the current scien - tific literature does not give such certainty. in the near future one can expect a complete description of the rare species of trichophyton eriothrepon , similarly, an extensive research on the microsporum aenygmaticum, being hard to identify, is still underway, and species introduced from geographically distant areas, such as trichophyton concentricum will likely be reclassified. the attention of mycologists is directed particularly towards the group of geophilic dermatophytes, which are still not sufficiently researched in comparison to the large number of their potential hosts and ecologi -fig. 3. p hylogeny and ecological classification of the most isolated dermatophyte species. legend: * t. benhamiae complex , **t. mentagrophytes complex , ***t. rubrum complex , **** m. canis complex , 1 s pecies classified only molecular. retractedtaksonomia dermatofitów – systemy klasyfikacyjne zmieniają się... 57 cal niches occupied. today, these species do not have a greater clinical significance, but, as the experts on the topic claim, evolution does not take breaks along the road towards life. acknowledgements the article was translated by euro-alphabet from polish into english under agreement 659/p-dun/2018 and funded by the ministry of science and higher education. references 1. a hmadi b., mirhendi h., makimura k., de hoog g.s., shid -

wości adaptacji do zmieniających się warunków środowiska. dermatofity chociaż stanowią jedna z najstarszych grup mikroorganizmów długo nie doczekały się stabilnego systemu taksonomicznego. co najważniejsze z klinicznego punktu widzenia, dermatofity wciąż przy - sparzają problemów diagnostycznych, co skutkuje błędami terapeutycznymi. rosnąca liczba zakażeń, w tym również odzwierzęcych, brak stabilności taksonomicznej i niejednoznaczny obraz kliniczny niektórych przypadków dermatomykoz powodują konieczność poszukiwa - nia nowych metod szybkiej, taniej i powtarzalnej identyfikacji gatunkowej tych grzybów. z kolei identyfikacja gatunkowa determinowana jest jasnością kryteriów klasyfikacyjnych uwzględniających poglądy klinicystów, epidemiologów i mykologów. w niniejszej pracy autorzy przedstawiają ewolucję systemów taksonomicznych dermatofitów na przestrzeni dziejów rozwoju mikrobiologii. odkrywanie nowych faktów z zakresu biologii i ekologii dermatofitów, jak również rozwój technik możliwych do zastosowania w laboratorium diagnostyki mykologicznej skutkowały opracowaniem nowych strategii identyfikacyjnych. współczesny system klasyfikacyjny tych patogenów oparty na badaniach molekularnych wydaje się być stabilny i szeroko akceptowany, czy jednak zakończy wiekowe zamieszanie klasyfikacyjne i okres setek zmian nomenklaturowych, będących koszmarem diagnostów? można wnioskować, że taksonomia dermatofitów, zwłaszcza gatunków antropofilnych, jest już wystarczająco dojrzała, aby ustabilizować się z korzyścią zarówno dla klinicystów, jak i naukowców. 1. wprowadzenie. 2. pierwsze systemy klasyfikacji dermatofitów. 3. fenotypowe systemy klasyfikacyjne. 4. „biologiczna” era w klasyfika -

able ability of this group of fungi to survive in different ecosystems results from their morphological and ecological diversity as well as high adaptability to changing environmental conditions. dermatophytes, although they are one of the oldest groups of microorganisms recognised as pathogens, nevertheless they have not been classified in a stable taxonomic system for a long time. in terms of diagnostics, dermatophytes still pose a serious problem in the identification procedure, which is often related to therapeutic errors. the increasing number of infections including zoonoses, lack of taxonomic stability, and ambiguous clinical picture of dermatomycosis cases necessitate a search for new methods for rapid, cheap, and reproducible species identification of these fungi. in turn, the species identification is determined by the clarity of classification criteria combined with the taxonomic division generally accepted by microbiologists and refer - ring to the views expressed by clinicians, epidemiologists, and scientists. in this paper, the authors present the evolution of taxonomic systems for dermatophytes over the history of microbiology development. discovery of new facts about the biology and ecology of der - matophytes and the development of techniques applicable applied in a mycological diagnosis laboratory facilitated development of new identification strategies at various points in the history. the modern molecular classification system of these pathogens seems to be stable and widely accepted. however, will it end the long-standing classification confusion and the period of hundreds of nomenclatural changes, which are diagnosticians’ nightmare? it can be argued that the taxonomy of dermatophytes, in particular that of anthropophilic species, is sufficiently established to be stabilised for the benefit of both clinicians and scientists. 1. introduction. 2. first dermatophyte classification systems. 3. phenotypic classification systems. 4. “biological” era in the classification. 5. ecological division of dermatophytes. 6. molecular revolution in the taxonomy of dermatophytes. 7. taxonomic problems in mycology. 8. clinical aspect of the taxonomy of dermatophytes. 9. current classification system. 10. indistinguishable “species complexes” . 11. summary słowa kluczowe: der matofity, taksonomia, metody identyfikacji, system klasyfikacyjny, nomenklatura key words: der matophytes, taxonomy, identification methods, classification system, nomenclature advancements of microbiology – postępy mikrobiologii 2019, 58, 1, 49–58 doi: 10.21307/pm-2019.58.1.049 retracted50 sebastian gnat, aneta now akiewicz, przemysław zięba 1. wprowadzenie infekcje grzybicze skóry, włosów i paznokci stano - wią najliczniejszą i najbardziej rozpowszechnioną grupę wszystkich grzybic. częstość występowania powierzch - niowych infekcji grzybiczych wzrosła w ostatnich dzie - sięcioleciach do takiego poziomu, że grzybice skóry dotykają obecnie ponad 20–25% światowej populacji, przez co są jedną z najczęstszych infekcji grzybiczych [4, 16, 17, 27, 45]. czynnikami etiologicznymi więk - szości grzybiczych infekcji powierzchownych są der - matofity [7, 11, 12, 22, 46, 60, 65, 66]. chociaż nazwa dermatofity jest powszechnie sto - sowana, to nie ma jednej uniwersalnej i akceptowalnej przez środowisko mikrobiologów definicji, a jej uży - wanie ma charakter raczej intencjonalny, do określania gatunków grzybów patogennych, posiadających zdol - ność rozkładu keratyny [28, 37, 65]. howard i wsp. [28] dermatofitami określają liczną w gatunki grupę blisko spokrewnionych keratynofilnych grzybów z rodzaju epidermophyton (sabour. 1907), microsporum (gruby 1843) i trichophyton (malmsten 1848), które powodują infekcje skóry, włosów, paznokci i innych wytworów naskórka i skóry właściwej. wszystkie gatunki derma - tofitów należą do rodziny arthrodermataceae (locq. ex currah 1985) i rzędu onygenales (cif. ex benny i kimbr. 1980). w tak ujętej definicji wątpliwości budzi nazywanie dermatofitami niepatogennych, saprofitycz - nych gatunków z wymienionych rodzajów, np. epi- dermophyton stockdaleae (prochacki i eng.-zas. 1974), microsporum boullardi (dominik i majchr. 1965), trichophyton ajelloi (ajello 1968), t. terrestre (durie i d. f rey 1957). dla odróżnienia tych niepatogennych gatunków od właściwych patogenów, a jednocześnie wskazania ich biologicznego powiązania zapropono- wano dla nich termin ,,dermatofitoidy” [32, 34]. 2. p ierwsze systemy klasyfikacji dermatofitów dermatofity jako jedne z pierwszych mikroorganiz - mów zostały opisane jako czynniki chorobotwórcze ówcześnie obserwowanych zmian skórnych u ludzi i zwierząt [34]. badania taksonomiczne tych grzybów zostały zapoczątkowane w 1841 roku przez roberta remaka i davida gruby’ ego [26]. pięć głównych gatun - ków dermatofitów uznawanych w dzisiejszych czasach za najistotniejsze epidemiologicznie, a mianowicie microsporum audouinii (gruby 1843), epidermophy - ton floccosum (langeron i miloch. 1930), trichophyton schoenleinii (langeron i miloch. ex nann. 1934), t. ton- surans (malmsten 1848) i t. mentagrophytes (sabour. 1895) zostało opisanych w latach 1841–1875 [51]. warto w tym miejscu zaznaczyć, że pierwsza klasyfi - kacja dermatofitów powstała kilka dekad przed opra -cowaniem przez ludwika pasteura metody uzyskiwania czystych kultur, co wskazuje na istotną zauważalność problematyki dermatomykoz w tamtych czasach [51]. jedynym współcześnie znanym gatunkiem dermatofita, którego brakuje na liście r. r emaka i d. g ruby’ ego jest trichophyton rubrum (sabour. 1911), a który został sklasyfikowany dopiero w xx w ieku [49]. hodowla i opis czystych kultur dermatofitów wpro - wadziły mykologię w swoistą epokę renesansu. nowo klasyfikowane dermatofity były określane na podsta - wie połączonych obserwacji zróżnicowanych zmian klinicznych liszaju obrączkowego (ringworm) powo - dowanego przez różne grupy ekologiczne dermato-fitów i opisów morfologii kolonii przeprowadzanych in vitro [50]. posługując się metodologią sabourauda jako standardem [50], w latach 1870–1920 wyodręb - niono kolejnych szesnaście gatunków dermatofitów, przede wszystkim związanych z infekcjami u ludzi. stosowanie tego samego standardu metodologicznego klasyfikacji dermatofitów doprowadziło w następnych dziesięcioleciach do wzrostu liczby opisów nowych gatunków i zamieszania nomenklaturowego. ogólna koncepcja określania przynależności do dermatofitów została wówczas zaburzona, a reguły taksonomiczne stały się niespójne, co skutkowało wielokrotnymi zmia - nami w nomenklaturze. zaowocowało to łącznie około 350 zmianami w nazwach gatunkowych w 1950 roku (ryc. 1) [12]. zasady klasyfikacyjne dermatofitów i jednolita nomenklatura anamorf zostały ustabilizo - wane dopiero po szerokich konsultacjach w środowisku mykologów, a rodzaje epidermophyton , microsporum i trichophyton stały się taksonami skupiającymi wszyst - kie dotąd poznane gatunki dermatofitów [11, 12, 60]. 3. f enotypowe systemy klasyfikacyjne pasterowska metoda otrzymywania czystych kultur została szybko implementowana do mykologii i takso - nomii dermatofitów [51]. morfologia pojedynczej ko- lonii grzyba, w połączeniu z jego obrazem mikroskopo - wym, stanowiły dobre parametry diagnostyczne [11]. wątpliwości dotyczące możliwości wykorzystywania w identyfikacji dermatofitów opisów makro- i mikromor - fologii czystych kultur pojawiły się dopiero w momencie badania powtarzalności tych cech [22, 34, 60]. udowod - niono, że izolaty pochodzące bezpośrednio ze zmian kli - nicznych cechuje charakterystyczna morfologia, która jest diagnostycznie użyteczna, ale jednocześnie morfo - logia ta zmienia się w wyniku pasażowania kultur [11, 12, 18]. standaryzacja szczepów referencyjnych była zatem trudna, co w konsekwencji doprowadziło do wprowadzenia licznych taksonów, które jednak obecnie uważane są za synonimy wcześ n iej opisanych gatunków [12, 64]. obecnie, już tylko historycznie, można wskazać retractedtaksonomia dermatofitów – systemy klasyfikacyjne zmieniają się... 51 przynajmniej dwadzieścia różnych gatunkowych nazw synonimicznych t. mentagrophytes , sześć t. verrusosum (e. b odin 1902) i po trzy dla m. canis oraz e. floccosum . ponadto, różne rodzaje odmian morfologicznych opisy - wano jako osobne taksony, np. keratinomyces longifu - sus (flórián i galgoczy 1964), będący w rzeczywistości microsporum fulvum (uriburu 1909) cechujący się silnie koherentnymi konidiami [41]. błędna klasyfikacja była zatem nieuniknioną kon- sekwencją systemu diagnostycznego opartego wyłącz - nie na fenotypie [16, 17, 22, 66]. co więcej, znanych jest obecnie co najmniej kilka gatunków dermatofi-tów, które zupełnie nie wykazują sporulacji lub bardzo słabo sporulują w hodowli in vitro . do takich gatunków z pewnością można zaliczyć trichophyton concentricum (r. b lanch. 1895) i t. schoenleinii (langeron i miloch. ex nann. 1934), które ze względu na brak swoistych cech fenotypowych w hodowlach in vitro często są identyfikowane w oparciu o charakterystyczny obraz i lokalizację zmian klinicznych [12, 29]. w ostatnich dziesięcioleciach xx w ieku stało się oczy w iste, że identyfikacja gatunkowa oparta na mor - fologii ma swoje ograniczenia i nie może być dalej wy- korzystywana. uwzględniając te problemy, weitz m an i wsp. [59] wprowadzili do diagnostyki dermatofitów dodatkowy zestaw testów fizjologicznych. zastosowa - nie między innymi tak zwanych „ trichophyton -agarów” pozwoliło wykazać zróżnicowanie zdolności poszczegól - nych szczepów do asymilacji panelu witamin. ponadto, zdolność wzrostu w różnych temperaturach i możliwość upłynniania żelatyny pozwoliły wprowadzić dodatkowe kryteria w różnicowaniu izolatów. nowe „konwencjo - nalne podejście” stosowane przy opisie gatunków der - matofitów stanowiło połączenie obrazu klinicznego infekcji, cech makroskopowych i mikroskopowych czy - stych kultur oraz ich fizjologii. jedynym nieuwzględnio - nym aspektem w tym podejściu była serologia szczepów, która nigdy tak naprawdę nie została wprowadzona do diagnostyki dermatofitów [11, 15, 32].4. „ biologiczna” era w klasyfikacji opisy stadiów teleomorficznych dermatofitów autor - stwa christine dawson i jeremy gentles’a [9] oraz phy - lis stockdale [52] pozwoliły wprowadzić do mykologii biologiczną koncepcję gatunku. owi badacze stwier - dzili, że niektóre geofilne i zoofilne dermatofity, jak również pokrewne im niepatogenne gatunki, takie jak trichophyton terrestre i t. ajelloi , rozmnażają się w pro - cesie płciowym. do określania stadiów doskonałych (teleomorficznych) tych grzybów zostały wprowadzone nazwy rodzajowe arthroderma (curr. 1860) i nanniz - zia (stockdale 1961) [9, 11, 52, 53]. w konsekwencji wzrosła liczba taksonów, a klasyfikacja i identyfikacja skomplikowały się przez wprowadzenie podwójnej nomenklatury dla tych grzybów (ryc. 2). o kreślenie typów płciowych dermatofitów zaczęło się w niezwykły sposób, gdy stockdale [53] odkrył, że u przedsta w icieli wielu, pozornie niezwiązanych ze sobą gatunków, można indukować proces płciowy w obecności szczepu testowego arthroderma simii (stockdale, d.w .r. mack. i a ustwick 1965). większość gatunków dermatofitów, dla których znane są stadia doskonałe (teleomorficzne) może być identyfikowana tą metodą. w toku prowa - dzonych badań okazało się, że trichophyton rubrum posiada typ płciowy określany jako (–), podczas gdy gatunek blisko spokrewniony t. megninii (r. blanch. 1895), obecnie uważany za synonim pierwszego z wy- mienionych, jest typu płciowego (+) [52, 53]. tylko dla kilku ważnych epidemiologicznie gatunków dermato - fitów, takich jak epidermophyton floccosum (langeron i miloch. 193) i t. soudanense (joyeux 1912) nie opi - sano do tej pory ich stadiów teleomorficznych [11]. summerbell [55] zwrócił uwagę na oczywisty czynnik ekologiczny łączący gatunki o nieznanych stadiach tele - omorficznych, mianowicie, wszystkie były zdolne do wywoływania infekcji u zwierząt i/lub człowieka. nato - miast do tej pory nie odnaleziono żadnych struktur roz - rodczych pozostawianych na keratynowych szczątkach ryc. 1. l iczba zmian nomenklaturowych gatunków dermatofitów z uwzględnieniem kryterium klasyfikacji i okresu rozwoju taksonomii retracted52 sebastian gnat, aneta now akiewicz, przemysław zięba roślinnych bądź zwierzęcych, które umożliwiałyby im późniejsze procesy płciowe. znajomość sekwencji genomowych wielu gatunków dermatofitów pozwoliła określić loci odpowiedzialne za typy płciowe [36]. stosując częściową amplifikację każ - dego locus , kano i wsp. [31] potwierdzili molekularnie, że 22 badane przez nich szczepy t. verrucosum wyka- zują tylko jeden typ płciowy. inne doniesienia naukowe [11, 12, 25] ujawniły, że pojedynczy typ płciowy wystę - puje u wielu gatunków, m. in.: t. tonsurans (malmsten 1848), t. equinum (gedoelst 1902), t. interdigitale (priestley 1917), t. schoenleinii (langeron & miloch. ex nann. 1934), t. rubrum , t. violaceum (sabour. ex e. bodin 1902), t. erinacei (a.a. padhye i j.w . carmich. 1969), t. concentricum , m. audouinii i m. ferrugineum (m. o ta 1921). potwierdza to pogląd, że dominującym sposobem rozmnażania tych grzybów jest bezpłciowa reprodukcja klonalna, która pojawiła się w konse - kwencji utraty jednego z typów płciowych (+) lub (–) na poziomie gatunku [12, 31, 36]. wyjątek stanowią tu gatunki zoofilne, takie jak t. benhamiae (y . gräser i de hoog 2016) i t. mentagrophytes , gdzie obydwa typy płciowe były obecne, ale w różnych proporcjach [56, 57]. na podstawie tych badań można wnioskować, że klonalne procesy bezpłciowe są dominującym sposo - bem rozmnażania się wszystkich dermatofitów antro - pofilnych i większości zoofilnych [12, 36]. podkreślenia wymaga też różnica w typach propagul rozmnażania bezpłciowego (konidiów) zależna od stadium życio - wego, w którym znajduje się grzyb [16, 19]. w czasie rozwoju w obrębie struktur włosa lub naskórka strzępki grzyba ulegają fragmentacji w celu wytworzenia licz - nych przetrwalnych, małych artrokonidii, stanowią - cych zarazem elementy infekcyjne [40]. z kolei bez - płciowe rozmnażanie grzybów in vitro daje zupełnie inne pokolenie zarodników, określanych makro- i mikro- konidiami [11, 16, 17, 21, 22]. ciekawych obserwacji dokonali anzawa i wsp., [2] którzy wykazali możliwość zachodzenia procesu płciowego pomiędzy wysoce kompetentnym szcze- pem testowym a. simii, wytwarzającym płodne poko - lenie, a szczepem t. rubrum . w wyniku krzyżowania tych szczepów uzyskano 35 askospor, z których jedna okazała się hybrydą obydwu krzyżowanych szcze -ryc. 2. t ypowi przedstawiciele gatunków i ich miejsce w historii taksonomii dermatofitów retractedtaksonomia dermatofitów – systemy klasyfikacyjne zmieniają się... 53 pów tych dwóch gatunków. wydaje się, że dermato -

wiska [12]. w rzeczywis t ości różne nisze ekologiczne w przypadku gatunków antropofilnych ( t. rubrum ) i zoofilnych ( a. simii ) ograniczają możliwości spoty - kania się w naturze szczepów o różnych preferencjach ekologicznych [2]. 5. e kologiczny podział dermatofitów duże różnice między gatunkami dermatofitów moż- na dostrzec w odniesieniu do ich naturalnego środowi - ska występowania. dotychczas opisano trzy grupy eko - logiczne dermatofitów: antropofilne, zoofilne i geofilne (tabela i). niejednokrotnie zaklasyfikowanie poszcze - gólnych gatunków do typu ekologicznego jest niemoż - liwe z powodu niewystarczających różnic fenotypo - wych i braku molekularnego wyznacznika [40, 43, 44]. gatunki antropofilne naturalnie kolonizują wytwory naskórka człowieka, przenosząc się między gospoda- rzami i powodując przewlekłe, ale łagodnie przebiega- jące infekcje głównie w obrębie gatunku homo sapiens [15, 40]. transmisja zakażenia na zwierzęta aczkolwiek sporadyczna jest uznawana za możliwą [40]. gatunki zoofilne bytują na zwierzętach, ich przeno - szenie na ludzi jest możliwe i częste, a odbywa się zwykle poprzez rezerwuary, którymi mogą być same zwierzęta, ich sierść lub przedmioty, z którymi miały styczność [16–20, 40, 43, 44]. dermatofity zoofilne izolowane od zwierząt, odpowiedzialne są za infekcje objawowe, ale niejednokrotnie bytują również bezobjawowo, czy - niąc zwierzę nosicielem i w tym przypadku mogą stać się źródłem epidemii [19, 20]. naturalnym miejscem bytowania dermatofitów geofilnych jest gleba, często wokół siedlisk (nor, jam) określonych ssaków lądowych [5]. ta grupa grzybów może być przenoszona przez zwierzęta mechanicznie na powłokach zewnętrznych [5, 15, 19], imitując bezobjawowe nosicielstwo, stąd różnica między dermatofitami geofilnymi i zoofil -nymi nie zawsze jest ostra. dodatkowo, gdy transmi - sja odbywa się na człowieka, gatunki zoo- i geofilne powodują grzybice o ostrym przebiegu z silnie wyra - żonymi objawami reakcji zapalnej [16, 20, 22]. dowody naukowe wskazują na zjawisko wysokiej zakaźności dermatomykoz zoofilnych wśród ludzi. niejednokrot - nie prowadzą do powstawania ostrych ognisk infekcji z wyraźnym pierścieniem na brzegu zmiany świad - czącym o silnym procesie zapalnym [20, 54]. z kolei większość infekcji powodowanych przez dermatofity geofilne ma przebieg łagodny, a ogniska mają charakter samoograniczający się [15, 54]. w toku prowadzonych w ostatnich latach badań nad filogenezą dermatofitów została zaobserwowana tenden - cja ewolucyjna, wskazująca zauważalny trend adapta - cyjny, od najstarszych dermatofitów geofilnych poprzez zoofilne do grupy dermatofitów antropofilnych. ostat - nia z wymienionych uchodzi za ewolucyjnie najmłod- szą, najsłabiej przystosowaną do różnych nisz ekologicz - nych, a zarazem wąsko wyspecjalizowaną do rozwoju na skórze człowieka [27, 64]. biologiczne wyjaśnienie tego zjawiska wydaje się być proste. dostosowanie do życia w stałym środowisku tkanek żywiciela spowo - dowało wtórną utratę wielu mechanizmów adaptacyj - nych, co wyraźnie zauważalne jest w utracie chociażby typów płciowych u antropofilnych gatunków [25, 64]. natomiast dermatofity geofilne, bytujące w zmiennych warunkach glebowych i podlegające ciągłej konkuren - cji ze strony innych mikroorganizmów, wykazują sze- reg cech adaptacyjnych, w tym zdolność rozmnażania płciowego [2, 64]. ogniwo pośrednie stanowi grupa der - matofitów zoofilnych. okrywa włosowa zwierząt jako nisza ekologiczna dla grzybów jest bowiem trudniejsza do opanowania niż skeratynizowane tkanki ludzkie, ale z pewnością łagodniejsza niż gleba eksponowana na zmienne warunki fizyko-chemiczne [47, 64]. wydaje się, iż wspólnego przodka wszystkich dermatofitów należy poszukiwać pośród gatunków geofilnych [25, 63]. tak przedstawiona charakterystyka poszczególnych grup dermatofitów wyznacza trzy typy ekologiczne, które chociaż nie są wyraźnie fenotypowo rozróżnialne, są zasadniczo odmiennie przystosowane do środowiska życia i mają również inne znaczenie kliniczne (tabela i). pochodzenie ewolucyjne o dległe p ośrednie b liskie proces płciowy b rak m ożliwy częs ty zmiany infekcyjne nie wielkie umi arkowane n asilone źródło zakażenia czło wiek zw ierzęta (możliwe także środowisko) śr odowisko (głównie gleba) leczenie p rzewlekłe ła twe, krótkie s amoistnetabela i charakterystyka grup ekologicznych dermatofitów cecha charakterystycznagrupa ekologiczna antropofile zoofile geofile retracted54 sebastian gnat, aneta now akiewicz, przemysław zięba 6. molekularna rewolucja w taksonomii dermatofitów podobnie jak w czasach ludwika pasteura, kiedy czyste kultury zrewolucjonizowały mikrobiologię, tak w ostatniej dekadzie xx w ieku zastosowanie metod molekularnych zrewolucjonizowało taksonomię derma - tofitów i innych grzybów. jako pierwsze markery mole - kularne w mykologii wykorzystano sekwencje dna kodujące białka małej i dużej podjednostki rybosomu [23, 33, 39, 47, 61]. gräser i wsp. [22, 24] zastosowali w badaniach taksonomicznych grzybów region its rdna (internal transcribed spacer ribosomal dna), co pozwoliło im sklasyfikować znaczną liczbę gatunków. ten marker molekularny był wielokrotnie wykorzysty - wany w późniejszych badaniach [10, 16–20, 25, 35, 42, 61, 63, 66], także w połączeniu z innymi, takimi jak gen beta tubuliny [47, 48] lub gen czynnika translacyjnego 1 [38]. na podstawie tych badań stwierdzono, że główna topologia rodziny arthrodermataceae jest molekularnie stabilna, ale nie w pełni odpowiada morfologii, ponie- waż rodzaj trichophyton wydaje się być polifiletyczny [24, 38, 47, 48]. filogenetycznie, antropofilne gatunki dermatofitów są najmłodsze ewolucyjnie i ograniczone do kilku zamkniętych klastrów, gatunki zoofilne, zwłasz - cza infekujące zwierzęta hodowlane, wiekiem ewolu - cyjnym zajmują pozycje pośrednią, stanowiąc ogniwo łączące z przodkami, gatunkami geofilnymi [12]. nowy system taksonomiczny sformalizował te różnice pocho - dzenia ewolucyjnego, co w zamyśle miało przekładać się na większą użyteczność w diag n ostyce laboratoryjnej. podczas gdy podejście molekularne w taksonomii dermatofitów było w stanie określić główne trendy ich ewolucji, okazało się ono zawodne w klasyfikacji i iden - tyfikacji kilku epidemiologicznie istotnych gatunków [25]. ugruntowane w mykologii pary gatunków, takie jak trichophyton rubrum / t. violaceum , t. equinum / t. tonsurans i do pewnego stopnia także trójka m. audo - uinii / m. canis / m. ferrugineum pozostała nierozróż- nialna molekularnie, nawet z zastosowaniem analizy wielolokusowej (multilocus) [12]. z tego względu jedy - nym rozwiązaniem tego problemu taksonomicznego może być podejście wielokierunkowe, łączące dane molekularne, ekologiczne, fenotypowe i uwzględniające cykle życiowe tych grzybów. 7. p roblemy taksonomiczne w mykologii głównym problemem taksonomicznym, często spo- tykanym w przypadku grzybów środowiskowych, jest nieoczekiwana różnorodność filogenetyczna izolatów, które wcześniej wydawały się fenotypowo monomor - ficzne [22, 25, 63, 64]. izolaty o podobnej makro- i mikro-morfologii niejednokrotnie okazują się przy - należeć do zupełnie innych gatunków, rodzajów, a nawet grup ekologicznych [22, 40, 60]. należy zaznaczyć, że sklasyfikowane na podstawie fenotypu dermatofity, pomimo zróżnicowania cech w obrębie równoważnych taksonów, należą zawsze do jednej linii ewolucyjnej, tj. rodziny arthrodermataceae [25]. o wspólnej filo- genezie wszystkich dermatofitów świadczyć mogą ich keratynofilne właściwości, które stanowią rzadką cechę w królestwie grzybów [64]. z kolei ewolucja w obrębie tej rodziny wykazuje silną koherencję z naturalnymi gospodarzami, zwierzętami lub ludźmi, dostarczającymi podstawowy składnik odżywczy – keratynę [63]. zależ - ność między gatunkiem dermatofitu a gospodarzem odnotowano w literaturze długo przed wprowadzeniem do taksonomii metod molekularnych, a przyczyny upa - truje się w zróżnicowaniu struktury keratyny u poszcze - gólnych gatunków żywicieli i zjawisku przystosowania patogenu do żywiciela [8]. drugim, aktualnym w mykologii problemem takso- nomicznym jest koncepcja gatunków molekularnych [22, 25]. długie lata po wprowadzeniu genetycznego kryterium do taksonomii obowiązywała reguła mówiąca, że w królestwie grzybów liczba gatunków określonych na podstawie badań molekularnych jest znacznie więk- sza niż ta, która została zdefiniowana w oparciu o kon - wencjonalne metody fenotypowe [3, 13, 21]. w lite-raturze dostępne są dane na temat mnogości typów genetycznych aspergillus fumigatus (fresen. 1863) [3], candida parapsilosis (langeron i talice 1932) [13] lub aureobasidium pullulans (g. a rnaud 1918) [21], które potwierdzają ten pogląd. dermatofity wydają się być jednak wyjątkowe pod tym względem. w ciągu ostat - nich 150 lat badań mykologicznych, skoncentrowanych głównie w ośrodkach europejskich z powodu dużej częstotliwości i różnorodności chorób powodowanych przez te grzyby, opisana została ogromna liczba fenoty - pów i genotypów dermatofitów [21]. obecnie na kon - tynencie europejskim, w oparciu o kryteria genetyczne zidentyfikowano 10 gatunków dermatofitów antropo - filnych [12]. jednakże w atlasie grzybów klinicznych [11, 12] wymienione zostało 103 taksony tego typu, a w literaturze badacze posługują się aż 242 nazwami synonimicznymi na opisanie tych samych 10 gatun- ków [12, 15]. tym samym, wydaje się, że w przypadku dermatofitów różnorodność gatunkowa obserwowana na podstawie wyników klasycznej identyfikacji jest znacznie większa niż realnie istniejąca różnorodność genetyczna. możemy wnioskować, że antropofilne, a przypuszczalnie także zoofilne, dermatofity zostały sklasyfikowane sztucznie, co doprowadziło do nagro-madzenia równoważnych taksonów, nie mających filo- genetycznego uzasadnienia [64]. podobne zjawiska zawyżenia liczby gatunków widoczne są w innych gru - pach grzybów o znaczeniu praktycznym, które zostały w związku z tym zbadane in extenso. przykładowo, gatunki rhizopus (ehrenb. 1821) łatwo rosną w hodowli retractedtaksonomia dermatofitów – systemy klasyfikacyjne zmieniają się... 55 in vitro , a ich przemysłowe wykorzystanie rozpoczęło się natychmiast po okresie pasteura, ze względu na ważną rolę w procesach fermentacji azjatyckich pro - duktów spożywczych na bazie soi [30]. fenotypowo opisano 43 gatunki synonimiczne rhizopus microspo- rus (tiegh. 1875) i r. arrhizus (a. fi sch. 1892), które molekularnie zredukowano do zaledwie dwóch [14]. innym przykładem jest wszechobecna alternaria alter - nata (keissl. 1912), zredukowana na podstawie analiz genomów do jednego gatunku, z pierwotnie licznych synonimicznych gatunków wyodrębnionych w oparciu o morfologię konidiów i typów konidioforów [62]. 8. k liniczny aspekt taksonomii dermatofitów obecne trzy główne rodzaje dermatofitów epider - mophyton , microsporum i trichophyton sklasyfikowane są na podstawie cech morfologicznych. tylko częściowo odpowiada to ich filogenezie [22]. najlepszym przy - kładem są gatunki należące do rodzaju trichophyton, w którym, pomimo że sklasyfikowane są grzyby speł - niające morfologiczne kryteria, częściowo mieszczą się dermatofity antropofilne i zoofilne, a częściowo także ich przodkowie, przeważnie gatunki geofilne [23, 24]. w związku z tym, szereg geofilnych gatunków tricho - phyton , odległych filogenetycznie od przedstawicieli dwóch pozostałych grup ekologicznych i prawie nigdy niepowodujących infekcji u ludzi i zwierząt, jest obec - nie rozpatrywanych w rutynowej diagnostyce na równi z patogenami [12, 15, 22]. z punktu widzenia ekolo- gicznego i klinicznego różnica między tymi grupami jest ogromna, ponieważ gatunki antropofilne i zoofilne są uważane za „prawdziwe” (obligatoryjne) patogeny, ponieważ mają przewagę ewolucyjną i są przenoszone między ludźmi bądź ich transmisja odbywa się ze zwie - rząt na ludzi [27, 64]. natomiast przytłaczająca więk- szość gatunków geofilnych jest oportunistami, a ich naturalnym środowiskiem bytowania jest gleba [60]. połączenie tak wysoce ewolucyjnie odległych grzybów w jednym rodzaju nie jest optymalne i może prowadzić do błędów diagnostycznych. filogeneza molekularna wyraźnie oddziela dermatofity geofilne od antropo - filnych i zoofilnych, co potwierdzają opublikowane wcześniej badania oparte na analizie sekwencji its [22], genu czynnika translacyjnego 1 ( tef1) [38] i genu kalmoduliny (cal) [1]. system taksonomiczny derma - tofitów użyteczny w diagnostyce klinicznej, stanowiący nowoczesne rozumienie identyfikacji, musi odzwier - ciedlać filogenezę molekularną, dodatkowo popartą danymi pochodzącymi z badań fenotypowych i oceny obrazu klinicznego, a więc powinien być wielokierun - kowy [12]. główne kryteria optymalnego określania gatunków powinny opierać się na koncepcji gatunków biologicznych, tj. możliwości losowego łączenia się pomiędzy szczepami tego samego gatunku oraz wyda- wania płodnego potomstwa i brak takiej możliwości między odrębnymi gatunkami [43, 44]. w praktyce mikrobiologicznej to kryterium często nie jest jednak łatwe do zastosowania. eksperymenty krzyżowania płciowego były szczególnie pomocne w wyznaczeniu gatunku microsporum gypseum (guiart i grigoraki 1928) i kompleksu t. mentagrophytes [56–58]. roz- mnażanie płciowe wielu gatunków dermatofitów czę - sto nie zostało opisane ex vivo, ponieważ warunki, w których produkowane są teleomorfy, są nieznane lub być może naturalnie nie istnieją specyficzne uwarun - kowania środowiskowe dla tego procesu [25, 43, 44]. w przypadku populacji tych grzybów przewaga liczeb - ności jednego typu płciowego może prowadzić do pre - ferowania rozmnażania bezpłciowego i wyjaśniać brak zróżnicowania wewnątrzgatunkowego [22, 25]. wów - czas gatunek będzie stanowiła populacja osobników o wysokim stopniu zgodności genetycznej, a koncepcja gatunków biologicznych zostanie wyrażona in silico na podstawie analizy podobieństwa genomów [22, 64]. de hoog i wsp. [12] korzystając z tej koncepcji zapro- ponowali system taksonomii dermatofitów oparty na sekwencjach czterech regionów genomu: fragmentu its, rybosomalnego 60s, genu dużej podjednostki rybosomu ( lsu) i genu beta-tubuliny ( tub). każdy z nich cechowała inna swoistość, umożliwiając wyod - rębnienie różnej liczby taksonów zgodnie z zależno - ścią its > tub > 60s > lsu [12]. wyniki tych badań wskazują, że sekwencja its rdna jest wystarczająco informatywna do analiz genomów dermatofitów, sta - nowi zatem optymalny marker w rutynowej diagno - styce, chociaż dla odróżnienia poszczególnych varietas niektórych „kompleksów gatunkowych” konieczne jest oparcie identyfikacji gatunkowej na analizie dodatko - wych genów i cech fenotypowych [12]. 9. ob ecnie obowiązujący system klasyfikacyjny wnioski z warsztatów mykologicznych zorganizo- wanych w 2016 roku przez cbs knaw fungal biodi - versity centre (the centraalbureau voor schimmelcul - tures fungal biodiversity centre, institute of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences) w utrech - cie w holandii pozwoliły zespołowi kierowanemu przez sybrena de hoog [12], zaproponować nowy system klasyfikacji dermatofitów oparty w głównej mierze na kryterium molekularnym. relacje taksonomiczne między członkami rodziny arthrodermataceae w tym systemie modelowo przedstawia drzewo filogenetyczne skonstruowane na podstawie analiz sekwencji its zlo - kalizowanych w obrębie rdna (ryc. 3). w obrębie za- mieszczonego filogramu można wyróżnić 7 głównych kladów. największy z nich obejmuje gatunki z rodzaju retracted56 sebastian gnat, aneta now akiewicz, przemysław zięba trichophyton, cechujące się polifiletycznym pocho- dzeniem ewolucyjnym. w jego obrębie znajdują się cztery gatunki zbiorowe (zmienne morfologicznie): trichophyton mentagrophytes kompleks, trichophy - ton benhamiae kompleks (y . g räser i de hoog 2016), trichophyton bullosum (lebasque 1933) i trichophy - ton rubrum kompleks. drugi klad zawiera pojedynczy gatunek epidermophyton floccosum , który jest parafi - letyczny i ewolucyjnie odległy od pozostałych derma- tofitów. oddzielny klad zawiera dermatofity klasyfiko - wane jako microsporum canis kompleks, a trzy pozo- stałe obejmują rodzaje lophophyton (matr. i dassonv. 1899), paraphyton (y . g räser, dukik i de hoog 2016) i nannizzia (stockdale 1961). najbardziej zróżnico- wany klad zawiera wiele gatunków obecnie znanych pod nazwą teleomorficzną arthroderma . zewnętrzną gałąź na drzewie filogenetycznym stanowi nowy takson guarromyces (y . g räser i de hoog 2016), do którego przeniesiono opisywany wcześniej antropofilny gatunek keratinomyces ceretanicus . 10. n ierozróżnialne „kompleksy gatunków” wyróżnione na podstawie analizy sekwencji its w obrębie rdna tzw. „kompleksy gatunków” są takso - nem wyższej rangi, w którym zgrupowane są nierozróż-nialne na poziomie its gatunki [12, 15]. chen i wsp. [6] zdefiniowali kompleks gatunków jako populacje różnych gatunków, które są wątpliwie odrębne. w przy - padku dermatofitów, kompleks gatunków oznacza tak -son różniący się genomowo jednoznacznie od innych taksonów rangi gatunku, podczas gdy, przy zastosowa - niu tego samego kryterium, nie wykazuje się zróżnico - wania poszczególnych gatunków wchodzących w skład kompleksu [12, 25, 35, 47]. największych trudności w różnicowaniu gatunków w obrębie gatunków zbiorowych (species complex) nastręcza specyficzność ekologiczna dermatofitów. weźmy pod uwagę t. mentagrophytes kompleks, będący jednolitym genomowo kompleksem gatunków t. menta - grophytes i t. interdigitale (priestley 1917) [22]. te dwa gatunki wykazują zupełnie odrębne przystosowania ekologiczne, pierwszy z nich jest stricte antropofilny, drugi – zoofilny [22]. podobnie, kryterium klasyfika - cyjne oparte na its rdna nie umożliwia zróżnicowania zoofilnego t. equinum od antropofilnego t. tonsurans [12, 22]. wymienione przykłady dotykają zasadniczego problemu w mykologii medycznej, uważa się bowiem, że infekcja u ludzi przez dermatofity zoofilne ma przebieg ostry ze znacznym stanem zapalnym, w przeciwień - stwie do łagodnych dermatomykoz, których czynni - kami etiologicznymi są gatunki antropofilne [5]. wia- rygodne ustalenie granic gatunków dermatofitów, a tym samym trafna identyfikacja gatunkowa, wymaga zatem podejścia wielokierunkowego. wówczas kumulatywna analiza danych molekularnych, fenotypowych i klinicz - nych pozwoli wyznaczyć biologiczne ramy poszczegól - nych taksonów dermatofitów zgodne ze specyfiką eko- logiczną tej grupy grzybów [12, 16, 18–20]. nie ulega wątpliwości, że konieczne są dalsze szczegółowe badania poświęcone temu zagadnieniu. ryc. 3. filogeneza i podział ekologiczny najczęściej izolowanych gatunków dermatofitów objaśnienie: * t. benhamiae complex, ** t. mentagrophytes complex, *** t. rubrum complex, **** m. canis complex, 1 ga tunek sklasyfikowany wyłącznie molekularnie. retractedtaksonomia dermatofitów – systemy klasyfikacyjne zmieniają się... 57 11. podsumowanie można wnioskować, że taksonomia dermatofitów, zwłaszcza gatunków antropofilnych, jest już wystar - czająco dojrzała, aby ustabilizować się z korzyścią dla klinicystów. aktualnie zdefiniowane taksony prawdo - podobnie nie ulegną drastycznym zmianom w najbliż - szej przyszłości, a prezentowana filogeneza nie okaże się błędna w toku wciąż prowadzonych badań. czy zatem stabilność nomenklaturowa dermatofitów została wresz- cie osiągnięta? przegląd aktualnej literatury naukowej nie daje takiej pewności. w niedalekiej przyszłości można się spodziewać pełnego opisu rzadkiego gatunku trichophyton eriathrepon , podobnie, wciąż trwają sze - roko zakrojone badania nad trudnym do zidentyfikowa - nia microsporum aenygmaticum, a gatunki zawleczone z geograficznie odległych obszarów, takie jak tricho - phyton concentricum ulegną zapewne reklasyfikacji. uwaga mykologów zwrócona jest w szczególności na grupę dermatofitów geofilnych, wciąż niewystarczająco przebadaną w porównaniu do ich dużej liczby potencjal - nych żywicieli i zajmowanych nisz ekologicznych. dziś gatunki te nie mają większego znaczenia klinicznego, ale, jak głoszą znawcy tematu, ewolucja w drodze życia nie zatrzymuje się na przystankach. piśmiennictwo 1. a hmadi b., mirhendi h., makimura k., de hoog g.s., shid -

gen, sygehusvej 5, dk-4000 roskilde, denmark. e-mail: disa@regions- jaelland.dk superficial fungal infections have been known since the 5th century bc, when hippocrates wrote about thrush in children. it took hundreds of years before the first scientific proof of infection was made by agostino bassi in 1835, who showed that the muscardine disease of the silkworm was caused by a fungus (1). in the following years audouin from france suggested that some human diseases were caused by the same types of plant parasites (fungi). by the end of the 19th century important microbiological methods, such as obtaining pure cultures of the dermatophytes trichophyton and achorion schoenleinii, were introduced. a morphologi - cal classification was not established until 1910, when the famous mycologist r. sabouraud published “les teignes”, a monograph based on the standardization of test media and studies on clinical features of skin and hair infections and morphology in cultures (1). at the beginning of the 20th century different nomenclatural systems were suggested, based on clinical presentation and culture characteristics. the taxonomy of superficial fungal infections has changed several times since then, due to the development of new diagnostic methods. unfortunately, this has resul - ted in many fungi having several names (synonyms). an attempt to simplify this, by giving “one fungus one name” has been initiated, and the development of molecular diagnostic methods has contributed to this process. this paper describes the latest changes in dermatophyte taxo - nomy and reviews currently available diagnostic tools. taxonomy the taxonomy of dermatophytes changed most recently at the beginning of 2017 (2). the phylogenetic tree in fig. 1, based on molecular data, shows the current valid nomenclature of the family arthrodermataceae. c. ser - ratus and g. ceretanicus were used as outgroups. before that, the family of arthrodermataceae, encompassing the dermatophyte fungi, included 3 anamorphic (fungi that have no sexual phase in their life cycle, also called imperfect fungi), trichophyton, microsporum, epider -a hundred years of diagnosing superficial fungal infections: where do we come from, where are we now and where would we like to go? yvonne gräser1 and ditte marie lindhardt saunte2–5 1institute of microbiology and infectious immunology, charité – university medicine berlin, corporate member of freie universität berlin, humboldt-universität zu berlin, and berlin institute of health, nationale reference laboratory of dermatophytes, berlin, germany, 2department of dermatology, zealand university hospital, roskilde, 3department of clinical medicine, university of copenhagen, copenhagen, 4unit of mycology, department of bacteria, parasites and fungi, statens serum institut, copenhagen, denmark, and 5european academy of dermatology and venerology task force for mycology co-chairactadv actadv advances in dermatology and venereology acta dermato- venereologica217 diagnosis of superficial fungal infections theme issue: cutaneous and genital infections mophyton, and one teleomorphic (fungi that have a sexual phase in their life cycle) genus ( arthroderma). as early as 2011, this dual nomenclature of fungi was abolished (3), mainly because the basis of taxonomy moved away from using morphological features towards molecular and phylogenetic data. on this basis, the teleomorphic genus in dermatophytes was abolished and 4 additional genera (nannizzia, lophophyton , paraphyton and arthroderma) were introduced to account for the former geophilic mi- crosporum and trichophyton spp. according to the rules of the botanical code. in principle, a separate genus was established at all main clusters (tips of the arrows in fig. 1) of the phylogenetic multilocus tree. medical concerns were also addressed, i.e. the anthropophilic and zoophilic species names were retained in the well-known genera microsporum, trichophyton and epidermophyton (2). at the species level, the nomenclatural changes that affected the medically relevant dermatophytes of the aforementioned genera were minor at this time. most of these taxonomic changes were proposed at the begin - ning of the 21st century. for example, the previous 50 anthropophilic and zoophilic trichophyton species were reduced to 19 (4), and in 2017 they were reduced by a further 3 due to the disappearance of the teleomorphic genus. here, corrections were carried out that mainly af - fected the classification of the dermatophytes into groups that encompassed their natural sources (anthropophilic, zoophilic, geophilic). for example, the anthropophilic and zoophilic strains of t. interdigitale, were separated once again, i.e. the zoophilic strains again received their own species name, t. mentagrophytes, whereas the anth - ropophilic strains were called t. interdigitale . due to this name change, the previous species t. mentagrophytes, which was phylogenetically closely related to t. scho - enleinii, had to be renamed. the name t. quinckeanum was used, because the originally described strains of t. fig. 1. phylogenetic tree of the majority of species of the family arthrodermataceae, based on the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal dna. actadv actadv advances in dermatology and venereology acta dermato- venereologica y. gräser and d. m. l. saunte218 theme issue: cutaneous and genital infections mentagrophytes var. quinckeanum clustered here (fig. 1). the skin fungus, trichophyton sp. of arthroderma benhamiae , which was isolated mainly from guinea pigs, was reduced to t. benhamiae. t. soudanense was removed from the t. rubrum complex and is now again listed as a separate species. new name combinations were also added, which were mostly geophilic species, due to the introduction of new genus names, e.g. microsporum gypseum was renamed nannizzia gypsea. the overall purpose of these changes was to base the new system on genetically robust determinants and to retain well-known dermatophyte names familiar to clinicians (2). clinical significance of fungal diagnostics taxonomy may seem remote from everyday clinical practice, but it is important in many ways: first, an ac - curate diagnosis is important for choosing the correct antifungal treatment (5, 6). species-specific diagnosis is sometimes also necessary, as different species may have diffierent antifungal susceptibility patterns (7). secondly, the species name also informs clinicians about the source of the infection. by knowing the source of infection, it is possible to treat the index patient or animal in order to reduce the risk of further spread of disease. thirdly, sub-species identification (strain typing) is useful in outbreaks as, for example, in india, where a specific t. mentagrophytes genotype viii has been uniformly isolated as a causative agent of a countrywide spread of a chronic, relapsing dermatophyte epidemic (8). by thoroughly studying this sub-species new knowledge about virulence and resistance may become available. finally, a negative fungal laboratory test is also important as a diagnosis of exclusion, when other dermatological diagnoses have also suspected. even though identifica - tion to genus or species level is important it is not always performed in the clinical setting (9–11). oral antifungal therapy should not be administered without a confirmed laboratory diagnosis, because up to 40% of the suspected diagnoses are wrong (9), and due to the possible side- effects and drug interaction, particularly in older patients who often have other underlying diseases and take additional medications. a third point is the potentially negative impact that unnecessary treatment may have on the human microbiome, and the increasing threat of drug resistance, which is well recognized with antibacterials, but can be equally applicable to antimycotics. traditional diagnostics: direct microscopy, histology and culture direct microscopy and culture have been used for the purpose of fungal identification over the last 100 years and are still used worldwide. the methods will be de- scribed in the following section.direct “non-specific” detection of fungal elements in clinical specimens direct microscopy is used for the primary identification of fungal elements in specimens after treating with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide (koh). conventional light microscopy, without the benefit of any contrast with the background, is difficult to interpret, and stains, such as lactophenol cotton blue, parker ink, chlorazol black e or congo red, are therefore often added. fluorescence microscopy after treatment of the specimen with opti - cal brighteners, such as blankophor or calcoflour, can enhance the detection rate after microscopy (12, 13). malassezia species show characteristic unipolar bud - ding blastoconidia, but with the exception of this genus it is important to note that direct microscopic findings are neither genus- nor species-specific, even though it is possible to distinguish yeasts from hyphae and to detect pigmented fungal cells. some very experienced technici - ans may be able to suggest a differentiation between other specific yeasts, dermatophytes and non-dermatophyte moulds, but without absolute certainty (14). direct microscopy of hair is important, as the growth pattern of the dermatophyte classifies it as either favus, endothrix (arthroconidia are present within the hair shaft) or ectothrix (where the fungus invades the hair shaft at mid-follicle and the arthrospores then grow out of the hair follicle and surround the surface of the hair shaft). the growth pattern, combined with the conidial size, can be used as a preliminary indication of the genus of the infecting dermatophyte (15–17). histology is not used routinely in skin and hair infections, but is useful when malassezia folliculitis is suspected, in order to rule out other causes of folliculitis. some dermatologists use histology routinely for fungal identification in nails, as it may rule out contamination and is able to confirm the growth of the fungus directly in the specimen (11, 18–20). however, the prerequisite for this is an invasive biopsy. genus- and species-specific identification culture is highly dependent on growth media, e.g. some media are more dermatophyte-specific, while others are better for yeasts and non-dermatophyte moulds. malas - sezia is lipid-dependent and, as a consequence, is often difficult to culture on normal laboratory media. culture of nail material is challenging, as up to 30% of microscopy- positive nail specimens are culture-negative (21, 22). this may be due to the presence of non-viable material, either because of insufficient material from the proximal area of infection, or due to previous antifungal treatment. combination of the different techniques is usually practiced, as it enhances the chances of fungal detec - tion and provides more clinically useful information. all traditional diagnostic methods are dependent on the skills of the laboratory technicians, whereas molecular actadv actadv advances in dermatology and venereology acta dermato- venereologica219 diagnosis of superficial fungal infections theme issue: cutaneous and genital infections diagnosis does not depend on the acquired skill sets of the laboratory staff, but may have other limitations, as described below. molecular-based detection of super- ficial fungal infections development of molecular-based methods for detection of dermatomycosis with the introduction of molecular tools into the taxo - nomy of dermatophytes approximately 30 years ago, species-specific markers, such as the internal transcribed spacer (its) region of ribosomal dna, were subsequent - ly used for the diagnosis of this fungal group. in the mid- 1990s, pcr methods were initially applied to cultured skin material. this included methods such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) and random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd) analyses, but also pcr fingerprinting (23–25). later, so-called in-house pcr methods were developed, which were also able to identify the fungus directly in clinical specimens. these methods are generally based on amplification with a broad range and/or specific primers and, in a second stage, use hybridization with species-specific probes with or without a combination of high-resolution mel - ting curve analysis. a distinction can be made between conventional and real-time pcr techniques. the former are more personnel-intensive because the hybridization step is performed separately and requires additional washing steps (enzyme-linked immunoassay (elisa), blot or microarray technique) and are more susceptible to contamination because the amplified dna is further processed manually. on the other hand, the thermal cy - clers required are less expensive than real-time devices. however, the advantages of real-time pcr are that both the amplification and hybridization steps are performed in the same closed reaction tube without the risk of con - tamination. this also eliminates additional bench hand - ling. however, it must be kept in mind that the number of probe hybridizations in conventional techniques is larger (e.g. 78 in the microarray format) than the number of colour labels (4–6), which are used to label different probes in real-time pcr technology. thus, melting curve analysis is used to extend the spectrum of species to be detected. nevertheless, these methods are not yet able to differentiate, at the same time, more than 20 clinically relevant dermatophyte species, including the few non- dermatophytes that can play a role in onychomycosis as infectious agents. such an all-in-one detection test would replace protracted phenotypic diagnostics based on culture, which ultimately requires expert knowledge because morphological features in this fungal group are both polymorphic and partially overlap. commercial kits for direct detection of fungal infections on skin, hair and nail samples since 2008, commercial systems, that use the above- mentioned detection methods and cover different spe - cies spectra, have been available. the dermatophyte pcr kit was developed by the statens serum institute (ssi), in copenhagen denmark in 2 versions; firstly, as a conventional pcr, and later as a real-time pcr that solely detects t. rubrum at species level, as it is the most common pathogen in onychomycosis and tinea pedis table i. species spectra detected by the commercially available test systems species/kit dpk ftd mmd mmd lf dg 1.0 dg 2.0 dd eadm t. tonsurans x v t. equinum x v t. interdigitale x v t. mentagrophytes x v t. schoenleinii x x v t. quinckeanum x x v t. simii x nd nd nd nd v t. erinacei x x x x x v t. benhamiae x x x x x v t. verrucosum x x x x v x v t. bullosum x nd nd nd x x nd v t. rubrum v v v v v v v t. violaceum x v v v v v v e. floccosum x v v v v v v v m. audouinii x v v v v m. ferrugineum x v m. canis x v n. gypsea x x v v x x v v n. fulva x x x x x x x v n. incurvata x x x x x x x v n. persicolor x x x x x x x v pan dermatophyte v x x v x x x v non dermatophyte x x v v v v x v same coloured boxes refer to the detection of species complexes, but not individual species. v: detects, x: do not detect. the identically coloured boxes mark the species in the respective kit, which are detected together (as a complex), i.e. not separated from each other. nd: no data; dpk: dermatophyte pcr kit; ftd: fast track dermatophytes; mmd: mentype mycoderm; mmd lf: mentype <mycoderm lateral flow; dg 1.0: dermagenius version 1.0; dg 2.0: dermagenius version 2.0; dd: dermadyn; eadm: euroarray dermatomycosis. actadv actadv advances in dermatology and venereology acta dermato- venereologica y. gräser and d. m. l. saunte220 theme issue: cutaneous and genital infections (table i). otherwise, the kit offers the possibility of detecting dermatophytes as a group (pan-dermatophyte), but this will include any non-pathogenic geophilic genera present. the conventional test system is based on a pcr with subsequent size analysis of the amplified dna fragments in an agarose gel, whereas real-time pcr uses hybridization probes instead. both test systems can be used for screening for dermatophytes, and this may be followed by subsequent species identification of non- rubrum species via culture or other molecular techniques, such as sequencing (26). in 2011, the ftd dermatophyte test from fast track diagnostics, was made available in sliema, malta. this test system, a 2-tube real-time pcr with probe hybridization, but without melting curve analysis, is able to detect 3 species (t. rubrum, t. violaceum, e. floccosum). the remaining detections are performed at species complex level, i.e. more than 1 species is detected here, but not differentiated from each other. this includes mainly dermatophytes species with different ecological niches: the t. tonsurans complex (no differentiation between t. equinum, zoophilic and t. tonsurans, anthropophilic), the t. interdigitale complex (t. interdigitale, t. schoenleinii antropophilic; t. menta - grophytes, t. quinckeanum zoophilic) and the m. canis complex (m. canis zoophilic, m. audouinii, m. ferrugi - neum anthropophilic). the kit does not have a detection option for the dermatophytes as a group. biotype in dres - den, germany launched the first version of the mentype mycoderm kit in 2013. these utilize 2 conventional pcr reactions, which can differentiate 2 species (e. floccosum and n. gypsea) on the basis of fragment size analyses. there is no differentiation between the t. tonsurans and the t. interdigitale complexes. t. rubrum is identified in a complex together with t. violaceum, as is m. canis complex. the second version of the test system (mentype mycoderm lateral flow) was available 2 years later with 3 pcr reactions. further developments affect, on the one hand, the procedure, because fragment analysis was replaced by probe hybridization on a blot strip. on the other hand, the species spectrum to be detected has been enlarged. now it is possible to detect t. rubrum, t. violaceum, m. audouinii at species level and m. canis in combination with m. ferrugineum. the t. tonsurans was separated from the t. interdigitale complexes. this was also the first kit that could detect t. benhamiae in a complex together with t. erinacei and t. verrucosum. another concurrent test system, dermagenius 1.0, from pathonostics, produced in maastrict, the netherlands, based on a single multiplex real-time pcr with melting curve analysis, had the same identification gaps and a similar species spectrum as the ftd kit. neither kit included pan-dermatophyte detection. this changed with the 2nd version of the kit (dermagenius 2.0), which became available in 2018. the species detection is the same as for mentype mycoderm kit lateral flow, with 2 exceptions. n. gypsea is not included, but t. verrucosum is. t. benhamiae is clustered together with t. equinum (27). at the same time, the dermadyn kit developed by dyn diagnostics ltd in ha’eshel st., israel became available. this test system is also based on a 2-tube multiplex pcr with a melting curve analysis and detects a similar spectrum to ftd dermatophytes (table i). in addition n. gypsea is detected, but the t. simii complex is not included (28). in 2018, the last of the kits discus - sed here, euroarray dermatomycosis from euroimmun, was launched in lübeck, germany. this is a multiplex pcr reaction with subsequent probe hybridization in the form of a “microarray”. this format enables the detection of all relevant (approximately 20) dermatophytes at the species level, including a pan-dermatophyte probe and 6 non-dermatophytes at the species level (scopulariopsis brevicaulis, fusarium and candida spp.). furthermore, there is species detection for rare pathogens, such as t. eriothrephon and t. bullosum. only t. concentricum, a pathogen endemic to the pacific islands, is not separated from t. benhamiae, and t. soudanense is not differentia - ted from t. rubrum because the taxonomic change that separated them came after the development of the kit. overall, the clinician should be aware that there is a difference between what the commercial tests are able to detect (table i). most importantly, the majority of tests do not discriminate between zoophilic and anthropophilic species, which is a necessary step in order to find (and treat) the sources of infection. another challenge is that many of the non-dermatophytes involved in the pathoge - nesis of onychomycosis are not detected in many of the kits. the broadest species-specific spectrum is offered by the euroarray. the other test systems do not detect non- dermatophytes (ssi, ftd), apart from c. albicans (der - magenius), or they provide detection of scopulariopsis and candida to genus level only (mentype) (table i). non-commercial molecular-based tests a considerable number of in-house pcr techniques have been developed for the diagnosis of dermatophytes and other skin pathogenic fungi. we do not describe these developments in detail here, because they are not stan - dardized, and in the vast majority of cases are used only by individual, or a few, laboratories involved in routine diagnostics. of particular interest are the methods based on real-time pcr. many of these approaches are able to identify up to 6 taxa and dermatophytes in general (29, 30). ohst and colleagues (31) were able to detect 9 dermatophyte taxa by combining up to 10 pcrs in a sequential algorithm, and bergmans and colleagues (32) could differentiate 11 species in a single-tube assay with probes and melting-curve analysis. walser & bosshard (33) report that using sloppy molecular beacons with species-specific melting temperature signatures allows the identification of 19 dermatophyte species. until now it has been possible to detect a similar number of actadv actadv advances in dermatology and venereology acta dermato- venereologica221 diagnosis of superficial fungal infections theme issue: cutaneous and genital infections species only by applying post-pcr techniques, such as an oligonucleotide array (34). this may be a promising approach for a commercial test system, if it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the 2nd species-differentiating pcr reaction, which was negative in 76% of cases where pcr1 (pan dermatophytes) was positive. another molecular-based method, matrix-assisted la - ser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrome - try (maldi-tof), is used to identify micro-organisms based on the characteristic protein spectrum of each spe - cies matched with a database. it has been applied to the identification of superficial fungal infection directly on culture material, both yeast, dermatophytes and moulds (35). this technique is fast and reproducible, but until now not applicable directly to clinical hair, skin or nail specimens (36–40). protein spectra of 7 and 10 dermato- phytes species (t. tonsurans, t. rubrum, t. interdigitale, t. mentagrophytes, t. verrucosum, t. violaceum, m. ca - nis, m. audouinii, e. floccosum, n. gypsea) are included in the widely used bruker and biomerieux reference spectrum databases (41). so far, this method is not able to differentiate the phylogenetically closely related species, e.g. t. rubrum/soudanense , t. interdigitale/ mentagrophytes, t. tonsurans/equinum or t. benhamiae/ concentricum complex (42, 43). identification can be improved by establishing an in-house database (44). it has also been used to detect antifungal resistance (45). other diagnostic tools wood’s light, filtered ultraviolet light, is often used as a bedside tool for differentiate tinea capitis caused by a microsporum species (canis, audouinii and ferrugineum) from other dermatophyte infections, as it fluoresces gre - enish under wood’s light, and endothrix infections are non-fluorescent (17). dermoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy, opti - cal coherence tomography and confocal laser scanning microscopy, all of which are non-invasive methods, can be used as add-on tools to differentiate tinea capitis and/ or onychomycosis from other dermatological conditions (17, 20, 46–48). dermatophyte screening test media, an agar medium containing a dermatophyte colour indicator can be used for dermatophyte screening. the anti-dermatophyte monoclonal antibody test, an immunochromatographic detection test, is able to confirm a dermatophyte infec - tion, detectable at genus level. some are known to give a false-positive reaction when non-dermatophytes are grown (22, 49–51). current routine diagnostic and their challenges the use of phenotypic methods (microscopy and culture) for the detection of pathogens in tinea is still wide spread. they are dependent on the skills of the laboratory technicians and culture is time-consuming. the culture method is still the only diagnostic method that is able to confirm the viability of the fungus, which is important for treatment assessment (11). microbiological laborato - ries appreciate the automation possibilities in molecular diagnostics and often have already established similar methods and devices that can also be used for derma - tophyte identification. decisive factors in determining whether to set up a molecular mycology service are the number of samples, the availability of trained personnel for direct microscopy, culturing and cost-effectiveness, which depends strongly on whether and how molecular dermatophyte diagnostics are remunerated. whether conventional diagnostics will still be used after the wider introduction of the molecular identification method de - pends primarily on the differentiated pathogen spectrum of the test system used. if not all relevant pathogens are covered, a pan-dermatophyte detection should be used in order not to miss a possible pathogen. however, even then, the detection of potential non-dermatophytes must be considered and, if not included, covered by diagnostics based on culture. it is, therefore, important to be aware of what fungi any locally available molecular test can or cannot detect. although molecular diagnostics are up to 30% more sensitive than culture diagnostics, the detection limit is more than one fungal cell (31). therefore, the clinical specimens must be taken from the correct location and in sufficient quantity. in this respect, there is no difference from culture diagnostics. the detection of pathogenic dermatophytes, whether in culture or pcr, always requires antifungal therapy, because asymptomatic car - riers also spread the fungi and can become symptomatic. disadvantages of the available molecular tests, in ge - neral, are that the evolution of fungi can lead to (point) mutations, especially in species-specific sequences used in the primers and probe, so that they can no longer bind, and false-negative results may be generated. this can be remedied by sequencing with broad-range or only dermatophyte-specific primers, which are more conserved and therefore less susceptible to mutations. sequencing can then provide accurate species identi - fication. some laboratories already routinely use these methods for fungal diagnostics. however, the purchase of a sequencing device is expensive and, like an in-house pcr, the method has to be validated. furthermore, there must be appropriately validated databases to enable cor - rect identification. clinical and laboratory interaction can improve the diagnostic outcome it seems logical that there should be coherence between what the clinician suspects and what the mycology labo - ratory is able to detect. nevertheless, in our experience actadv actadv advances in dermatology and venereology acta dermato- venereologica y. gräser and d. m. l. saunte222 theme issue: cutaneous and genital infections this it often not the case. as described, different fungi have different needs for substrates in order to grow, and some molecular-based tests do not detect all relevant fungi. it is therefore important to inform the mycology laboratory, as a minimum, from which anatomical region (hair, skin or nail) the specimen is obtained, which der - matological disease, and fungal (dermatophyte, candida, malassezia or non-dermatophyte mould) genera is sus - pected (table ii). furthermore, the attending physician should note on the referral form whether an animal contact is probable and whether, for example, a mycosis with a non-dermatophyte is considered in onychomyco - sis. the microbiologist needs this information in order to interpret the results of the molecular tests correctly, but also to decide whether a culture should be created in parallel if the kit has gaps in its repertoire. future perspectives the advantages of molecular diagnostics for the initial diagnosis of dermatophytosis are beyond question. a few studies have, so far, shown that the method can also be used for therapy monitoring (52, 53). iwanaga et al., in particular, have demonstrated that the fungal load after 16 weeks of terbinafine therapy is significantly reduced (from 100% to 36%) (53). the patients’ culture were already negative at this time, but, microscopically, fungal elements could still be detected in the koh preparation. the most plausible explanation for this is that resting fungal cells (e.g. in the form of arthroconidia) are still present and may potentially germinate again after dis - continuation of therapy. the survival of dormant fungal cells inside the nail is supported by follow-up studies, which after 18 months show a complete cure in only 76% of elderly patients receiving 3-month terbinafine therapy (54). dormant cells are missed in the culture. therefore, therapy control with pcr procedures may be suitable in the future, not to mention the short time-span in which such a finding is available, in order to decide whether to continue the therapy. only very special pcr procedures are able to discriminate between live and dead cells; however, it is not known how long dormant fungal cells survive in the nail, hair or skin of the human body (55). to date, there has been no significant development of resistance in dermatophytes to the use of antimycotics. this has suddenly changed with the indian epidemic, which has lasted for approximately 6 years, and goes hand in hand with the use of over-the-counter ointments containing antimycotics (e.g. terbinafine), antibiotics and steroids (e.g. clobetasol). terbinafine resistance or partial resistance in t. mentagrophytes strains with genotype viii and t. rubrum reach rates of more than 65% and table ii. helpful information for the clinician to differentiate between suspected fungal pathogens, which is needed for the laboratory for choosing the most appropriate diagnostic methods anatomical regionhelp for the clinician to differentiate between suspected fungal pathogensessential information for the microbiologistinformation helpful for the microbiologist disease most common clinical signs age suspected pathogen exposure scalp (hair region)tinea capitis broken hairs kerion favus alopecia scalingchildren dermatophyte animal exposure endemic contacts woods light results earlier treatment seborrhoeic dermatitis/ dandruffgreasy skin scales on erythematous skin newborn adultsmalassezia face tinea faciei area with raised erythematous border or red patchall ages, but mostly childrendermatophytes animal exposure signs of tinea capitis seborrhoeic dermatitis greasy skin scales on erythematous skin primary centro-facial and eyebrowsadults malassezia upper body pityriasis versicolor hypo- or hyperpigmented maculae young and adults malassezia immunosuppression malassezia folliculitis monomorphic pustules mainly located at seborrhoeic areas. no comedonesyoung and adults malassezia immunosuppression tinea corporis area with raised erythematous border or red patch. skin scalesall ages dermatophyte animal exposure other signs of tinea hands tinea manuum area with raised erythematous border or red patches. skin scales. hyperkeratosis.all ages other signs of tinea e.g. tinea pedis groin & pubic areacutaneous candidiasis erythematous skin folds with satellite pustules (and skin scales)all ages candida immunosuppression tinea cruris area with raised erythematous border or red patch. skin scalesadults dermatophytes seborrhoeic dermatitis greasy skin scales on erythematous skin adults malassezia feet cutaneous candidiasis interdigital maceration all ages candida immunosuppression tinea pedis interdigital maceration, skin scales, raised erythematous boarder, ’moccasin foot’, thickening of the solesall ages dermatophytes cutaneous non-d mould infectioninterdigital maceration mostly adults non-d moulds immunosuppression nails candida onychomycosis paronychia nail dystrophyall ages candida immunosuppression moist exposure tinea unguium hyperkeratosis, superficial white discoloration, yellow streaks. all ages, but prevalence increases with agedermatophytes concomitant tinea pedis? non-d onychomycosis hyperkeratosis, discoloration, paronychia/ inflammation, nail dystrophyall ages, but prevalence increases with agenon-d moulds non-d: non-dermatophyte.actadv actadv advances in dermatology and venereology acta dermato- venereologica223 diagnosis of superficial fungal infections theme issue: cutaneous and genital infections 17%, respectively, in india and are spread globally (56). this means that t. mentagrophytes strains will have to be fine-typed by molecular genetics in order to determine the exact identity, or a susceptibility test has to be per - formed. the advantage of the latter is that breakpoints can be defined; the disadvantage is that the inoculum, due to the filamentous growth and the often poor coni - dia formation of the fungi, is challenging and therefore not done routinely. molecular methods, in particular sequencing with detection of specific genetic mutations leading to antifungal resistance (e.g. squalene epoxidase gene mutation leading to terbinafine resistance), which are independent of the fungal growth could overcome this problem (8, 56–59). conclusion the diagnosis of superficial fungal infections has evolved from the first microscopic description more than 100 years ago to current techniques that are able to detect a wide range of clinically relevant fungi using molecular- based techniques. worldwide traditional diagnostic methods, such as direct microscopy and culture, are still used, as they are cheap and the equipment is already available. the development of molecular-based methods has already improved a lot during the last years, from only being able to detect fungi in cultures to now being able to detect fungi directly in clinical samples. the molecular species-specific fungal detection of clinically relevant fungi is possible, as well as detection of spe - cific mutations causing antifungal resistance. if it were possible to combine all these tests, it would enable the clinician to obtain the correct species identification, the possible source of infection and the susceptibility pattern of the involved pathogen by sending a single sample. the evolution of the diagnosis of superficial fungal infections is not far from this goal. acknowledgement professor roderick hay is acknowledged for his constructive comments and for reviewing the text. conflicts of interest: dmls was paid as a consultant for advisory board meeting by abbvie, janssen, sanofi and received speaker’s honoraria and/or received grants from the following companies: abbvie, galderma, astellas, novartis and leo pharma during the last 3 years. yg received speaker’s honoraria and grants from euroimmun. references 1. kane j, summerbell r, sigler l, krajden s, land g. labo -

original article abstract background: early forecasting of any pathological process is of great significance from both medical and economic point of view. an illness requires much more attention in the light of exhaustion of resources of the body, and a doctor should be maximally aware of the near and far future of a patient. in this regard, the preparation of forecasting programs on a mathematical basis would be a rational and, most probably, the only true approach to the solution of forecasting. aims and objectives: the aim of the article is to study the forecasting of atopic dermatitis (ad) in newborns. methodology: the authors studied 109 clinical and laboratory indicators in children without and with ad. discriminant analysis was used as an algorithm for the resolution of diagnostic issues. results: the main indicators acceptable as a forecasting criterion in the formation of ad in children were defined. the sensitivity, specificity, and general diagnostic value of statistically valid differing factors in the formation of ad were studied. key rules of the forecast were formed after processing all indicators through the ku–kruskal–wallis discriminant criterion, a universal computer method. conclusion: it was concluded that the power of influence of rhinitis, cluster of differentiation 31, mucin 2, and intestinal trefoil factor 3 are higher in the ad model. key

both medical and economic points of view.[1‑3] an illness requires much more attention in the light of exhaustion of resources of the body, and a doctor should be maximally aware of the near and far future of a patient.[4,5] the knowledge about the result of each individual case would ensure the inclusion of the patient in a more or less vulnerable group. thus, this study discusses the choice of necessary therapeutic approach as well as the assessment of the consequences of various methods of treatment.[6‑10] the analysis of literary information indicates that the assessment of illness forecasting based on individual or isolated indicators is not promising.[11‑13] in this regard, the preparation of forecasting programs on a mathematical basis would be a rational and, most probably, the only true approach to the solution of forecasting.[14‑19] any event in clinical medicine can be currently assessed as a probable process and studied by the theory of probability. these conditions would ensure the application of mathematical methods based on the principles of probability with the possibility of positive results in the forecasting of the course of the illness. recently, more attention is attached to the application of exact sciences in medicine and the establishment of mathematical expert systems on computers. it will help intellectualize the decisions of doctors and prevent unpleasant results based on algorithms, including the facilitation of individual preventive measures.[20‑22] materials and methods discriminant analysis was used as an algorithm for the resolution of diagnostic issues. key rules of the forecast were formed after processing all indicators through ku–kruskal–wallis discriminant criterion, a universal computer method. at this stage, 63 forecasting criteria were selected for further analyses. after thorough processing of these 63 indicators by means of discriminant (pearson’s chi‑square) and disperse (analysis of variance test – f‑fischer) methods, statistically and specifically different 28 clinical and 6 laboratory indicators were kept for the formation of the model. thus, certain indicators have less rate from the

clinical factors to 19 by combining certain indicators under the title of “other antenatal factors” and “other neonatal factors.” receiver operating characteristic (roc) analysis was conducted for the evaluation of laboratory indicators (forecasting markers), the cut‑off point was determined based on the coordinates of roc curves, and the sensitivity and specificity of the markers were calculated. correct application of probability methods requires correlative non‑dependence of forecasting criteria. thus, overlapping of unilateral results of correlative indicators could lead to a strong disruption of the truth in forecasting. we selected 15 non‑correlative indicators during the correlation analysis (p‑spearman) between the results. first, we used to distribute these indicators under the principle of available/not available, i.e., there is atopic dermatitis (ad) (should not be ad). in this case, it is advisable to apply the bayes formula. to this end, there are two theories: h1 – hypothesis 1: this value of the indicator is characteristic of ad positive (ad+) children; h2 – opposite hypothesis 2: this value of the indicator is characteristic of ad negative (ad‑) children. obviously, the sum of the hypotheses is (eq. 1): p (h1) + p (h2) = 1. (1) then, bayes formula is as follows (eq. 2): ()()()1 1 11( ad / h ) ( ad ) (h /ad ) , ad h / ad ad (h / ad )p pp pp pp+ ++ + +− −×= × +× (2) whereas p (ad+/h1) is the conditional probability of the formation of ad in a child within the h1 hypothesis; p (ad+) is the unconditional probability of the formation of ad in a child; p (h1/ad+) is the conditional probability of the value of the indicator being in conformity with h1 hypothesis in a child with ad; p (ad−) – 1 − p (ad+) is the unconditional probability of the absence of ad in a child; p (h1/ad+) is the conditional probability of the value of the indicator being in conformity with h1 hypothesis in a child without ad. before calculations, it is admitted in the vaguest way that ad+ and ad− probabilities are equal at first glance (eq. 3): p0(ad+) = p0(ad−) = 0.5. (3) taking into account every next factor, a posteriori probabilities are calculated under the bayes formula: p1, p2,…. it is obvious from the above that the sequence of the calculation for every specific case is conducted under the bayes formula. the next stage of the attempt to establish a forecasting program exceeded the borders of the theory of probability and the science of mathematical statistics. thus, it was impossible to determine a one‑digit probability of ad formation on a specific unit of laboratory indicators. therefore, we had to refer to elements of the theory of “fuzzy” logic. to this end, we gathered the laboratory results of children with and without ad into a “fuzzy” multitude in the form of an n‑sized ellipsoid with focuses being medians of ad+ and ad− multitudes. then, we divided this ellipsoid into the multitude of interconnected ellipsoids through percentile evaluation. this allowed us to determine the point of connection of the ellipsoid in the form of the one‑digit (given any set of laboratory results) on every specific occasion. as the focuses of the ellipsoid are obvious, the distances to the focuses of each point became a metric for us. these figures were normalized and recognized as an unconditional probability, which allowed us to conclude calculations on a forecasting model again under the bayes formula. according to the requirements of “fuzzy logic” theory, we rejected absolute “0” and absolute “1” for determining the distance to avoid any indefinite situations and made use of 0.01 or 0.05 instead of “0” and 0.99 or 0.95 instead of “1” – figures close to former ones, depending on the shape of the ellipse on each specific occasion. a special “adyr‑2019” program was worked out in visual basic algorithm language based on ms excel‑2013 component for modeling the above. the program management only requires a doctor to enter patient data in necessary boxes within seconds with the help of capabilities at the user level. the program controls the information entered as well, thus a doctor is called to be careful by marking the box with false data as “false.” it should be noted that cases in the absence of any information about patients are also taken into account. in this regard, the result is calculated even in the absence of any information in that box. however, the inclusion of all data selected in the program ensures a more accurate result; thus, it is advisable to mark all boxes. the program calculates the probability of ad in an examined child and submits the result on a chart [ figure 1 ]. such information would play a vital role in the selection of future treatment tactics by a doctor. the program is protected from accidental amendments and requires standard ms office software on a simple

newborns and without ad were taken into consideration for the evaluation of results. according to the quantity of real positive and real negative results, “specificity” and “sensitivity” were evaluated in the adyr‑2019 program. results in the current research, we sought to define the main indicators acceptable as a forecasting criterion in the formation of ad in children. from this point of view, we studied 109 clinical and laboratory indicators in children without ad (i group – n = 260) and with ad (ii group – n = 268). the sensitivity, specificity, and general diagnostic value (gdv) of statistically valid differing factors in the formation of ad were studied [ table 1 ]. the highest sensitivity (67.9 ± 2.9%) and gdv (64.2%) among the above‑mentioned factors are noted in allergic factor on parents; the highest specificity (94.2 ± 1.4%) and the effect of evaluation under positive predictive value (71.2 ± 6.3%) and likelihood ratio of the positive result (2.39 – satisfactory) include seasonal factor. table 2 presents the specificity, sensitivity, and gdv of neonatal pathologies and symptoms. the highest sensitivity and gdv among the above‑mentioned factors is rhinitis; the

and constipation; the highest effect of evaluation under positive predictive value is food allergy and wheezing, and the highest effect of evaluation under negative predictive value is rhinitis. the likelihood ratio of positive results (lr+) is observed in the frequency of symptoms of rhinitis (1.77 – satisfactory) and food allergy (2.08 – satisfactory), and it is of great importance in forecasting ad. a more sensitive roc analysis was held on the markers of genetic and mucous membrane among laboratory indicators where statistically valid differences are monitored [ figure 2 and table 3 ]. apparently, a great part of the roc curve for the cluster of differentiation 31 (cd31) marker is located above the standing line. in other words, the cd31 immunological marker has high specificity and sensitivity in the formation of ad. the area of the roc curve amounts to 0.685 ± 0.56 (95% energy intake (ei) – 0.578– 0.791), and the likelihood ratio was calculated as p = 0.002. as it is obvious from the roc curve, the area of specificity in the reliability interval at 95% of histamine receptor h4 (hrh4) allergic marker comprises 0.604 ± 0.56 ( p = 0.52), and referential indicators vary between 0.494 and 0.714. according to the results, this marker may be considered as the one with high specificity and sensitivity in newborns. figure 3 and table 4 describe the results of the roc analysis in the classification of the markers of the mucous membrane. the area of specificity of the roc curve of the g1 marker amounts to 0.551 ± 0.50 ( p = 0.307). referential indicators

according to the roc curves, mucin 2 (muc2) and intestinal trefoil factor 3 (itf3) genetic markers have high specificity and sensitivity in children with ad. thus, the area of specificity of muc2 calculated under the roc curve is equal to 0.692 ± 0.046 ( p < 0.001), and its upper and lower limits in reliability interval at 95% are accordingly 0.601 and 0.783. the area of specificity of itf3 constitutes 0.740 ± 0.048, and referential indicators in reliability interval at 95% vary between 0.645 and 0.834. the roc analysis of the two indicators, which do not differ in a common group, but statistically validly differ, at the same time, which are noted in medical literature were held in the population studied previously [figure 4 and table 5 ]. according to the roc curve, immunoglobulin e (ige) and vitamin d (vitd) indicators are considered markers with low specificity and low informative value. thus, the area of specificity of ige is 0.534 ± 0.063, and its referential indicators at 95% ei are 0.411 and 0.658. the upper and lower limit of vitd at 95% ei is defined accordingly as 0.441 and 0.565; its area of specificity is 0.503 ± 0.032. apparently, neither ige nor vitd indicators can be recognized as sensitive and specific indicators in the formation of ad. the next stage envisages finding cut‑off points – the farthest point from the standing line among interval figures at a variation interval of the indicators in the result of roc analysis. the calculation was conducted on statistically valid differing indicators in the roc analysis [ table 6 ]. it should be noted that a positive solution direction in forecasting ad in children was not observed in pediatric practice. the power of influence of the factors present in the model prepared based on the results was calculated with the help of the fischer–snedecor method at the next stage, and the final results are described in table 7 .based on the factors studied, itf has the highest informative value, thus the fact is the quantity of this factor ( n = 101 persons) is higher than 25.0; its specificity, informative value, and gdv are, respectively, 50.8 ± 6.4%, 95.0 ± 3.4%, and 68.3 ± 4.6%; the effect of evaluation under positive and negative predictive value is accordingly 93.9 ± 4.2 and 55.9 ± 6.0, which proves that this indicator is of great importance for forecasting of ad. according to the results of the correlation analysis, direct proportionality was found between the zone factor and allergy on the father, allergy on the mother, and food allergy; and inverse proportionality was found with the constipation factor. table 5: results of roc analysis of the statistically valid different indicators volatility of test results (s)area standard errorp likelihood.reliability interval at 95%

specific diagnostic tests for ad. diagnosis of the disorder is based on specific criteria that take into account the patient’s medical history and clinical manifestations.[26,27] ad occurs as a result of complex interactions between genetic factors, the environment, infectious agents, defects in the barrier function of the skin, and impaired immune response. knowledge of etiological factors allows for adequate therapy, as well as primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of this disease in children. according to research, the most important in the etiology of hypertension is burdened heredity of allergic pathology in families of children, as well as environmental conditions with factors of their influence, on which the child grows, develops, and stays. new information on hypertension indicates that both structural abnormalities of the skin and immune dysregulation play an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease. therefore, the optimal treatment of hypertension requires a multifaceted approach aimed at healing and protecting the skin barrier, as well as the impact on the complex immunopathogenesis of the disease. direct proportionality is observed between allergy factor on the father and wheezing, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, food allergy, sensitive skin, trouble sleeping, muc2, and itf3. it shows that in the case of an allergy factor on the father, a newborn is at high risk of formation of such neonatal and antenatal symptoms.[20] direct proportionality exists between allergy factor on the mother and autoimmune illnesses, wheezing, rhinitis, food allergy, and cd31 factors. this dependence shows that in the case of an allergy factor on the mother, there is a high risk of autoimmune illnesses, at the same time, symptoms of wheezing, rhinitis, and food allergy may be noted in a newborn.[23] children born via cesarean section demonstrate a higher quantity of hrh4 and muc2 markers, thus their thickness is directly proportional to this factor.[24] wheezing observed in newborns has direct proportionality to conjunctivitis, rhinitis, food allergy, sensitive skin, trouble sleeping, constipation, cd31, hrh4, and muc2.[25] according to correlation results, damage to mucous membrane is observed through conjunctivitis, rhinitis, food allergy, sensitive skin, and trouble sleeping symptoms in newborns; and the increase of markers of mucous membrane proves it once again. in a clinical setting, the proposed models can be used in the development of treatment tactics for newborns with ad.table 6: role of markers in the formation of

power of influence of rhinitis, cd31, muc2, and itf3 factors are higher in the ad model. however, since the informative value of all factors used in forecasting is accompanied by statistical validity, the use of all factors in the model is advisable for the sake of more accurate results. the most sensitive factors are rhinitis; the highest specificity is food allergy and constipation; the highest effect of evaluation under positive predictive value is food allergy and wheezing; and the highest effect of evaluation under negative predictive value is rhinitis. thus, damage to intestinal mucosa with the influence of perinatal risk factors is an initiating and significant factor of atopic allergy. the identification of early and significant risk factors in the formation of ad would allow classifying a risk group with postnatal allergic pathology and preparing a set of treatment and preventive measures for the prevention of the formation of ad. the results obtained can be used in the selection of future treatment tactics by a doctor. ethics committee all procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional

true negative = tn; false positive = fp; false negative = fn; limit of detection = lod; sensitivity; speciﬁcity) ( table 1 ). data included here that was not provided in the main study was extracted from the supplementary material. the speciﬁcity data of the qpcr reactions were extracted. for the target sample, the ct level was obtained for 100% of the species type of the meat samples (mixes were not taken into account) and cross-reactivity with other types of animal and plant dna was also conducted. cytochrome b gene was the most commonly used to detect the target species. the limit of detection (lod) was evaluated in targeted samples, the series of dna dilutions of which was carried out only from pure targeted meat. dna from mixes of different types of meat at a certain concentration and ratio were excluded from the calculation. fig. 2 . meta-analyses evaluating the reported test parameters for accuracy (including sen- sitivity and speciﬁcity) were conducted. because there is no separate data on the number of false-positive, true-positive, false-negative, and true-negative results in many publications, the analysis used the results provided in the assessment of speciﬁcity. all data analyses were per- formed using review manager 5.4 software. the sensitivity of the quantitative pcr method for identifying meat products when control- ling for adulteration of products was 100%, 95% ci, 93.3%–100%; heterogeneity between trials of i 2 = 0%. the results of speciﬁcity were 99.4%, 95% ci 98.2%–99.9%; heterogeneity between trials of i 2 = 0%. fig. 3 . positive likelihood ratio (plr) and negative likelihood ratio (nlr) were measured with a 95% conﬁdence interval based on the tp, tn, fp, and fn rates that were extracted from the results of analytical speciﬁcity of included studies. the results of pooled positive likelihood ra- tio (plr) were 24.30, 95% ci, 13.19–44.79 and pooled negative likelihood ratio (nlr) were 0.16, 95% ci, 0.08–0.29. fig. 4 . results of the sroc curve were performed using meta-disc 1.4 software. an area under the curve (auc) close to 1 indicated a good diagnostic performance of the test. in this study the a.n. iskakova, g.k. abitayeva and a.b. abeev et al. / data in brief 41 (2022) 107972 5 table 1 characteristics of the included studies. general study details lod speciﬁcity # authors target species method gene number of samples с t ±sd concentration [ng/ μl] number of samples с t of target species false- positive true- positive false- negative true- negative 1a wang et al.

- the studies use the real-time pcr method; - studies published in english or russian. studies were excluded if the с t value (cycle threshold for analytical speciﬁcity) and the limit of detection were unavailable. data extraction. the research design of most studies on meat product adulteration is based on the use of prepared mixes with different meat concentrations. the presented data of the pcr test systems on real commercial samples of meat products are diﬃcult to interpret as false positive, true positive, false negative, and true negative due to the lack of data on reference standards. it should be understood that the results of reference standards, in this case, cannot be used in the classical sense of meta-analysis. for example, many publications use the same real-time pcr method as a standard method, but use primers for 16s rrna [ 8 , 10 ] and 18s rrna [ 9 , 11 , 12 ]; that is, positive results, when carrying out quantitative pcr, were evident in all analysed samples. as a result of the aforementioned limitations, we decided to use the speciﬁcity analysis re- sults. these results are the closest to those required for a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the tests. these results are similar in all publications. in the selected studies, we can interpret the results as false positive, true positive, false negative, or true negative because we know the exact composition of the tested samples. in fact, the samples can be considered a standard. data extraction was conducted by one author (iskakova, a.n.). the following data points were extracted from the selected studies: title of the studies, names of the ﬁrst author, year of pub- lication, number of samples and species, methods, target gene, and test system results (true positive, tp; true negative, tn; false positive, fp; false negative, fn; limit of detection, lod; sen- sitivity; speciﬁcity) ( table 1 ). data that were not provided in the main study are extracted from the supplementary material. during the study of publications, some researchers used the analytical sensitivity concept as a synonym for the lod concept. however, it is worth understanding that they are not inter- changeable. the detection limit is the lowest detectable level of analyte distinguishable from zero. whereas, the analytical sensitivity is the slope of the calibration curve. the analytical sen- sitivity indicates the capacity of the method to differentiate between two very close analyte concentrations [14] . the limit of detection (lod) was evaluated in targeted samples, the series of dna dilutions of which was carried out only from pure targeted meat. dna from mixes of different types of meat at a certain concentration and ratio were not used in the calculation. data analysis. all data analysis were performed using review manager 5.4 and meta-disc 1.4 software. sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive likelihood ratio (plr), and negative likelihood ratio (nlr) were measured with a 95% conﬁdence interval based on the tp, tn, fp, and fn rates that were extracted from the results of analytical speciﬁcity of the included studies. sensitivity is the probability that a test result will be positive when the test target species exists (true positive rate) and calculated as tp/(tp + fn). 8 a.n. iskakova, g.k. abitayeva and a.b. abeev et al. / data in brief 41 (2022) 107972 speciﬁcity is the probability that a test result will be negative when the test target species is not present (true negative rate) and calculated as tn/(tn + fp). sroc curves: an area under the curve (auc) close to 1 indicated good diagnostic performance of the test. since we performed a meta-analysis of only one method (real-time pcr) and did not divide the data into subgroups, it was decided not to carry out the diagnostic odds ratio (dor) analysis. quality assessment was not performed because the study was carried out for a meta-analysis, in which the results of a speciﬁcity test were used as data (that is, the samples themselves acted as a standard). in this regard, the given assessment results do not reﬂect the assessment of the entire study in publications, but only the data that were used for meta-analysis. ethics statement not applicable. declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial interests or personal rela- tionships that could have inﬂuenced the work reported in this paper. data availability datasets of variables and tabular results (reference data) (mendeley data) credit author statement aisha n. iskakova: methodology, visualization, formal analysis, writing – original draft;

ne us academic publishersadvances in animal and veterinary sciences2019 | volume 7 | special issue 1 | page 21 introduction in kazakhstan, dermatophytoses of various etiology and localization are widespread among people and animals (levchenko (2005), bayduysenova (2007), schurikhina (2010), baydusenova et al., 2006; schurikhin, 2009; levchenko et al., 2005). among people, rubromycoses, dermatophytoses, athlete’s feet of various etiology, onychomycoses, candidiases, as well as zoophilous microsporia and trichophytia have been identified. the most epidemiologically important are trichophyton (t) verrucosum, t. mentagrophytes, t. rubrum, microsporum canis. among animals, t. verrucosum and m. canis have been identified most frequently (kukhar et al., 2006). studies of the prevalence of the anthropophilic and zoophilous dermatophytoses, skin dermatomycoses, athlete’s feet and onychomycoses performed by various authors have shown that these diseases are very common in various countries and in specific population groups (weitzman et al., 1998; gudnadottir et al., 1999; ellabib et al., 2002; dogra et al., 2002; ungpakorn et al., 2004; djeridane et al., 2006; borman, 2007; ngwogu and otokunefor, 2007; anane et al., 2007; sarma et al., 2008; fekiha et al., 2012). dermatomycoses and yeasts are the most frequent pathogens of skin mycoses in humans and in animals; however, the percentage of their identification varies depending on the geographical region. there are reports about changes in the spectrum of dermatophytoses pathogens (gainullina and panin, 2009). the high frequency of occurrence and the wide range of pathogens require changes in the strategy and the tactics of diagnostic and therapeutic measures. currently, microscopy and isolation of the pathogen cultures are proposed for diagnostics of dermatophytoses; however, intraspecies fungi identification using these methods is hindered. the share of the identified pathogens using the cultural research article abstract | dermatophytoses is a group of specific diseases caused by the dermatomycetes fungi. these diseases are common in humans and animals and are found ubiquitously. recently, there have been increased numbers of fungal agents causing skin mycoses. this work aimed at the identification of dermatomycoses pathogens in humans and animals circulating in the territory of kazakhstan. a total of 509 samples of pathological material from animals and human volunteers from various regions of kazakhstan have been studied. as a result, 167 pure cultures of fungi were isolated, and their cultural and morphological characteristics were studied. a total of 80 strains of dermatomycetes, yeasts, and molds have been identified, including the genetic one. the most frequent were molds–64.3 %, dermatomycetes–22 %, and yeast–13.7 %. changes had been noted in the range of dermatophytoses pathogens in humans and animals in the republic of kazakhstan. pathogens of dermatophytoses in animals and humans were mold saprophytic fungi (64.3 %), dermatomycetes (22 %), and yeasts (13.7 %). the widest range of atypical pathogens was detected in the imported cattle.

sensitivity of microscopy is 53.8 %. the laboratory diagnostics of mycoses is complicated by the fact that fungi structure varies considerably depending on the cultivation conditions. the reasons for untimely diagnosis are the incomplete examination of patients with the diseases, restricted to clinical examination and fluorescence examination; the frequency of atypical manifestations of fungal infections that has increased to 34 %; and the changes in the spectrum of pathogens (novoselov et al., 2003). this research work was aimed at identifying dermatomycetes isolated from patients and animals with dermatophytoses using classical and molecular genetic methods. materials and methods samples of pathological material from the animals were taken according to the requirements of veterinary clinics of astana and livestock breeding farms in the akmola, north kazakhstan, and karaganda regions. human samples were taken from anonymous volunteers in outpatient hospitals, nursing homes, and the drug rehab clinic. it was obtained from volunteers agreed to fence biological material. the total of 509 samples of the pathological material were taken, of which 254 samples were taken from animals, and 255 samples were taken from humans. for primary isolation of the fungi, sabouraud’s slope agar was used. the clinical material had been soaked in 70 % alcohol for 20 minutes. the material was sown in three repetitions for each sample. cultivation was performed on slope agar at ph of 6.5–6.9, and the temperature of 28º c for 5 to 30 days. the pure culture was isolated on agar in petri dishes. for studying the morphological peculiarities of saprophytic fungi and dermatomycetes, agar blocks and scotch preparations were prepared, and microscopy of smears in 50 % glycerol was made (kurasova et al., 1971). the fungi were identified using appropriate identifiers (sutton et al., 2001). for genetic identification, multilocus sequence typing with primers its5 and its4, ns1 and ns4, rpb1 and rpb2, ssu4 and ssu5 was used. the nucleotide sequences were analyzed and combined into the common sequence in software seqman (dna star), identified in gene bank using the blast algorithm (clayton et al., 1995). resul ts and discussion the dermatophytoses occurrence rate in kazakhstan was analyzed according to the data of the ministry of health and the ministry of agriculture of the republic of kazakhstan. it was found that dermatophytoses in humans were quite common and were caused by various pathogens.the trichophytia occurrence rate in the population of the republic in 2000 was 4.7 per 100,000 of population, in 2007, the value increased to 9.68, and the peak in the republic of kazakhstan was observed in 2004–12.75. with that, the incidence rate of people with trichophytia in nine regions of the republic over seven years was above the average (11.6): south kazakhstan (34.9), akmola (20.4), aktobe (16.8), kyzylorda (14.8), almaty (12.9), east kazakhstan (12.5), atyrau (12.5), karaganda (12.3), and zhambyl (12.0). of the total number of pathogens, most commonly found in humans was trichophyton rubrum (20.4 % of the total number of cases). onychomycoses caused by candidae sp. made 12.6 %, by epidermophyton sp.–9.4 %, and by t. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale –7.6 %. in 24.9 % of cases, the species of the pathogen was not veraciously identified, in 4.9 % of cases, the results were negative. in russia, this indicator in the same years was 2.5, while in uzbekistan it was 13.4 (kukhar et al., 2012). a tendency to increasing the incidence rate of microsporia has been identified from 2.574 thousand in 2001-8.153 thousand in 2002. microsporia incidence rate currently remains quite high, although between 2002 and 2007, a clear tendency to reducing the incidence rate was observed. in 2007, the number of microsporia cases was 5.282 thousand (levchenko, 2007). cattle trichophytia is identified throughout the entire territory of kazakhstan. cases of the disease were observed in the akmola and the karaganda regions. mass skin lesions caused by pathogens of trichophytia were observed among animals in the imported meat livestock. with that, the disease often progresses in the malignant form, causing atrophy and defects of skins, has an atypical clinical picture, and may not always be treated with vaccine preparations. these lesions can be attributed to changes in the fodder base, the effects of stress during transportation and keeping at the quarantine site, prolonged adaptation to new territorial and climatic conditions, and by the absence of immunity to the disease, which results in the appearance of previously non-existent species of pathogens of skin lesions, as identified during the studies in a number of farms in the akmola, karaganda and north kazakhstan regions (kukhar et al., 2012). in analyzing the primary sowings of the material ( table 1), growth of dermatomycetes–classic pathogens of dermatophytoses: trichophyton sp. and microsporum sp – was observed in 13.6 % of cases. in addition to the characteristic growth of dermatomycetes, the authors had identified typical growth of mold fungi mucor sp., penicillium sp., aspergillus sp., stemphyllium sp., alternaria sp., phoma sp., chaetomium sp., eurotium sp., and other soil fungi. their share was 33.2 % of all the identified micromycetes. growth of various yeasts was observed in 10.2 % of cases. ne us academic publishersadvances in animal and veterinary sciences2019 | volume 7 | special issue 1 | page 23 table 1: analysis

speed, and their colonies were formed in 3–5 days. growth of trichophyton colonies was observed on days 5–10, of microsporia–on days 3 – 6. colonies of yeasts were formed on days 1–3. in 43 % of cases (219 samples), growth was not observed. figure 1: colonies of isolates trichophyton interdigitale. in the figure, letters a, b, c, and d show the front side, and letters e, f, g, and h show the

of the colonies.as shown by the data in table 1, the highest percentage of isolation from the animal and human pathological material was observed for nondermatophyte fungi, including molds. the second occurrence rate was observed for dermatomycetes. pure cultures of dermatophytoses pathogens were identified by classical and molecular genetic methods. the cultural properties of dermatomycetes colonies featured a variety of properties. on agar, there were isolated, often rounded, opaque colonies with abundant or scarce growth with a diameter of 3.0 – 7.0 cm. the edges of the colonies were often smooth, but there were also curl-shaped, indented, and wavy edges. the profile of the colonies was convex; the color was often white. the phenomena of polymorphism and pleomorphism were observed, especially in later reseeding (figures 1, 2, 3 and 4). figure 3: clinical isolates of trichophyton verrucosum from the front side of the colonies. colonies of t. interdigitale were farinose, velvety or powdery, usually folded, all had solid consistency with a pronounced pigment of various shades of brown (figure 1). colonies of t. rubrum featured many forms and colors. a characteristic feature was the accumulation of the wine-red pigment of varying intensity. the color of the colonies was white, beige, some strains were pink (figure 2). colonies of t. verrucosum were leathery, velvety or powdery with moderate growth, regular rounded shape, of dense consistency, with the diameter of 30–50 mm, the edges were smooth, the color was white, the profile – convex, and the surface–wrinkled. the substrate mycelium grew to the inside and firmly connected with the dense nutrient medium (figure 3). ne us academic publishersadvances in animal and veterinary sciences2019 | volume 7 | special issue 1 | page 24 the colonies of strains m. canis were floculent, creeping or dense powdery, of white to brown color. colonies of t. tonsurans were creamy, friable, had a beige color with expressed pigment on the reverse side of the colony (figure 4). figure 4: clinical isolates of m. canis and t. tonsurans (strain #86). the figure shows the front (a, b, c, d) and the

pigment of intense wine-red color, the pathogen of plaster trichophytia t. interdigitale features the presence of a pigment of light-yellow color and dome-shaped elevation in the center of the colony, the pathogen of microsporia features pronounced polymorphism, characterized by a formation of intensive fluffy mycelium, dark brown color of the colonies, and mealiness. table 2: the results of the

academic publishersadvances in animal and veterinary sciences2019 | volume 7 | special issue 1 | page 25 from the center, and in old cultures of dermatomycetes of genus trichophyton, arthrospores and chlamydospores were found. figure 6 shows septate branching mycelium t. verrucosum (a), coiled mycelium (b), terminal chlamydospores t. mentagrophytes (c), intercalary chlamydospores t. rubrum (d),

rubrum (l), and formation of a colony of t. verrucosum (m). in the gram-stained smears, the mycelium of dermatomycetes was presented in the form of soft thin septate filaments, and, when stained, had a light purple color. microconidia had darker color and were tightly attached to the mycelium. the microscopic analysis of mold fungi allowed identification by the presence of characteristic morphological features (figure 6). next, genetic identification of fungi was performed using multilocus sanger sequencing. the nucleotide sequence of target genes of dermatomycetes and molds was determined at the collective use laboratory of rse “national center for biotechnology” of the scientific committee of the ministry of education and science of the republic of kazakhstan (hereinafter refered to as the mes of the rk). after performing pcr on two pairs of primers its4-its5 and d1-d2, dna samples were purified for sequencing. after decoding the dna, the results were populated into the database on website www.ncbi.com with the use of the international blast database, and the obtained results were analyzed and compared to the data of the website. as a result, 80 strains of fungi were identified. the nucleotide sequences of the studied species were deposited in ncbi genbank data base ( table 2). conclusion the results of the research show a wide spread of dermatophytoses, which is also confirmed by statistical data of the mes of the rk. along with the characteristic pathogens, which include dermatomycetes fungi, several uncharacteristic pathogens were identified, including chaetomium globosum, alternaria alternate, aspergillus versicolor, and other saprophytes and yeasts. the results of the studies are consistent with the data presented in the works of the employees of the reference mycological laboratory and other authors (kurasova et al., 1971; kukhar et al., 2012). the combination of classical mycological and modern molecular-genetic methods made it possible to study the species diversity of pathogens of onychomycoses, trichophytia, and microsporia in the residents of astana, in the animals in astana, the akmola, the north kazakhstan, the karaganda regions, and to identify them up to species with high accuracy. according to the results of studying pheno- and genotypic characteristics of the identified dermatomycetes, the main pathogens of rubromycosis, trichophytia, and microsporia in humans are mold saprophytic fungi (64.3 %) rather than classic dermatomycetes (22 %). yeasts were isolated in 13.7 % of cases. the widest range of atypical pathogens was detected in the imported beef cattle (sergeev, 2008). therefore, in kazakhstan, along with dermatomycetes, pathogens of dermatophytoses in humans and animals are yeasts, soil fungi, phytopathogens, and other micromycetes. the comparison of the phenotypic and the genotypic characteristics has shown that the results of the studies are not 100 % similar. the results of the studies are consistent with the work of the scientists who reported insufficient correctness of primers its and ssu when working with dermatomycetes (frealle et al., 2007). therefore, the following final conclusions can be proposed: 1. 509 samples of skin, nails, and hair pathological material were studied; 167 pure cultures of fungi were isolated, and their cultural and morphological characteristics were studied. 95 cultures were defined using typical methods.2. genetic definition of fungi was performed, which were pathogens of skin mycoses circulating in the area of northern kazakhstan and western siberia, 80 species of dermatomycetes, yeast and fungi were identified.3. changes had been noted in the range of dermatophytoses pathogens in humans and animals in the republic of kazakhstan. pathogens of dermatophytoses in animals and humans were mold saprophytic fungi (64.3 %), dermatomycetes (22 %), and yeasts (13.7 %). the widest range of atypical pathogens was detected in the imported cattle. acknowledgments the article has been prepared based on the results of the research within the framework of a grant on topic “phenotypic and molecular genetic characteristic of
